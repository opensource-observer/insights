# Project Structure Reorganization Summary

## Overview
The project structure has been successfully reorganized to improve clarity and maintainability by grouping related functionality together and eliminating confusion between pipeline, processing, and scripts directories.

## Changes Made

### Directory Structure Changes

#### Old Structure:
```
src/
├── cli/                   # Command line interface
├── config/                # Configuration and settings
├── pipeline/              # Core pipeline components
├── processing/            # Dependency source implementations
├── scripts/               # Standalone scripts
└── utils/                 # Utility functions
```

#### New Structure:
```
src/
├── cli/                   # Command line interface
├── config/                # Configuration and settings
├── core/                  # Core domain logic and data management
├── services/              # External services and integrations
├── dependency/            # Dependency-specific operations
├── importers/             # Data import functionality
└── utils/                 # Utility functions
```

### File Movements

#### From `pipeline/` to `core/`:
- `data_manager.py` → `core/data_manager.py`
- `dependency_snapshot.py` → `core/snapshot.py`
- `repository_manager.py` → `core/repository.py`
- `repository_fetcher.py` → `core/repository_fetcher.py`
- `repository_source_manager.py` → `core/repository_source_manager.py`

#### From `processing/` to `services/`:
- `ai_service.py` → `services/ai.py`
- `summary_generator.py` → `services/summary_generator.py` (moved from pipeline/)

#### From `processing/` to `dependency/`:
- `dependency_sources.py` → `dependency/sources.py`
- `fetcher.py` → `dependency/fetcher.py`

#### From `scripts/` to `dependency/`:
- `map_dependencies_to_github.py` → `dependency/mapper.py`
- `clean_dependencies.py` → `dependency/cleaner.py`
- `analyze_dependencies.py` → `dependency/analyzer.py`

#### From `scripts/` to `importers/`:
- `import_csv_sbom.py` → `importers/csv.py`

#### From `scripts/` to `core/`:
- `initialize_repository_sources.py` → `core/initialize_repository_sources.py`
- `manage_repository_sources.py` → `core/manage_repository_sources.py`

#### CLI Renaming:
- `interactive_workflow.py` → `interactive.py`

### Import Statement Updates

All import statements in the following files have been updated to reflect the new structure:
- `src/cli/main_cli.py`
- `src/cli/interactive.py`
- `src/core/repository.py`
- `src/services/summary_generator.py`

### Documentation Updates

- Updated `README.md` to reflect the new project structure
- Updated command examples to use the new module paths

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
   - `core/`: Central business logic and data management
   - `services/`: External service integrations (AI, GitHub, OSO)
   - `dependency/`: All dependency-related operations consolidated
   - `importers/`: Data import functionality clearly separated

2. **Improved Discoverability**: 
   - Related functionality is grouped together
   - Easier to find specific features based on domain

3. **Better Scalability**: 
   - New features can be added to appropriate domains
   - Reduces confusion about where to place new code

4. **Reduced Duplication**: 
   - Eliminates overlap between pipeline, processing, and scripts
   - Consolidates related functionality

## Verification

The reorganization has been tested and verified:
- CLI commands work correctly with new import paths
- All functionality remains accessible through the main CLI interface
- No breaking changes to the external API

## Migration Notes

For developers working with this codebase:
- Update any custom scripts or imports to use the new module paths
- The CLI interface remains unchanged for end users
- All existing functionality is preserved in the new structure
