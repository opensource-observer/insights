USX and Unitus V1 was audited by Trail of Bits, ConsenSys Diligence, Certora and Certik: https://github.com/dforce-network/documents/tree/master/audit_report/Lending Unitus V2 audit review was conducted by MixBytes in Jun 2024: https://github.com/UnitusLabs/Contracts/blob/main/docs/audit/UnitusV2-Security-Audit-Report-By-MixBytes.pdf sUSX audit review was performed by MixBytes in Aug 2024: https://github.com/dforce-network/documents/blob/master/audit_report/sUSX/dForce_sUSX_Security_Audit_Report.pdf

**Please briefly answer all project details questions**

Brief description of the project and what it aims to achieve: dForce has been an active participant in the crypto space since the 2019 bear market, successfully navigating several bull and bear cycles. dForce was initially founded by Mindao , along with a group of former Wall Street professionals and developers, and is backed by several world-class investors, including CMBI, Multicoin Capital, and Huobi Capital. dForce boasts a total volume of $11.7B with $151M total assets, 991K transactions, and 38,775 total users across all chains. USX is now the #5 stablecoin on Optimism by TVL with $5.7m, and have established liquidity pools on Velodrome to support the trading of USX and sUSX. Our mission is to create a permissionless liquidity infrastructure for Web3 dApps. We've developed a comprehensive suite of Web3 infrastructure protocols, including decentralized stablecoins ( USX ), general money markets ( Unitus Finance ), and a bridge . USX is now the #6 largest stablecoin by TVL ($5.8m) on Optimism. USX is a decentralized stablecoin that can be minted through an over-collateralized loan on Unitus, at a fixed rate through Vaults, or via a 1:1 swap from USDC, USDT, and DAI. It can be bridged across all supported L1/L2 networks with high efficiency and minimal costs (only gas fees apply). sUSX, the savings version of USX, redistributes protocol revenues to USX holders who stake on the platform. Currently, sUSX offers 8% APR across all supported networks, including Ethereum, Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, and BSC. Users can redeem USX for USDC, USDT, and DAI on the platform, or buy/sell USX on Velodrome. Unitus is a general lending protocol that supports a variety of assets, including stablecoins, blue-chip assets, LSD assets, RWAs, and yield tokens like sDAI and sUSX. Through integration with USX, Unitus enables more flexible and realistic cross-chain lending. Unitus V2 is firstly launched on the Base network, offering SuperCharged Mode , Segregated Mode , and Time-Locked feature , which are designed to enhance accessibility and liquidity for correlated assets, unlock greater capital efficiency for long-tail crypto assets not yet present on Unitus V1, and provide an additional barrier against malicious activities, further safeguarding users' assets. 2. Success potential (Explain why your project is likely to succeed. Consider market demand, technical feasibility, and your team’s ability to execute): We have demonstrated our success by launching dForce protocols across various L1 and L2 networks, including Ethereum, Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, and BSC. Currently, USX boasts a circulating supply of $15.2 million and ranks in the top 6 on Optimism with a market cap of $5.8 million. Additionally, Unitus has achieved a total value locked (TVL) of $5.5 million. 3. Mission alignment (Describe how your project aligns with the goals of the mission request you are applying for): dForce has introduced lending support for wstETH and rETH on Unitus Finance, in addition to a wide array of bluechip assets and widely adopted stablecoins, allowing users to lend and borrow for diverse investment strategies. Additionally, users can now use iwstETH as collateral to mint USX, enabling further financial opportunities. 4. Novelty (Highlight what makes your project unique or innovative): Unitus: Unitus makes it possible for users to explore yield opportunities across multiple chains without the need to move their collateral cross-chain. You can supply assets as collateral on one blockchain to borrow different assets on another using USX as the liquidity conduit. Unitus offers SuperCharged Mode , Segregated Mode , and Time-Locked feature in V2 (currently available on Base network only), which is designed to enhance accessibility and liquidity for correlated assets, unlock greater capital efficiency for long-tail crypto assets not yet present on Unitus V1, and provide an additional barrier against malicious activities, further safeguarding users' assets. Unitus is also committing to integrating RWA elements to provide sustainable yields for our users and diversify our revenue by incorporating RWAs into our portfolio, starting off from GMMF01 token launched by DigiFT Global . USX: USX is now the #6 largest stablecoin by TVL ($5.8m) on Optimism. USX is the first stablecoin that offers consistent and top-tier supply interest across all networks supported, including Ethereum, Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, and BSC, through sUSX, the saving version of USX. Integrated with Unitus, users can supply USX or sUSX as collateral to borrow other assets, further improving capital efficiency. 5. Will the project be open source? Yes 6. Free or fee-based for end users? Free for lenders and borrowers. However, the protocol will charge a small fee, deducted from the interest spread on Unitus and minting fees for USX. 7. Is it composable with other projects on Optimism? How? Yes, all dForce protocols are permissionless and fully composable with other DeFi protocols. Unitus is a general lending protocol that can support any assets, subject to governance approval. USX is already supported on Unitus, Velodrome, Celer, and more.

Competitors and differentiation Lending protocols: Aave, Compound, Silo Finance, Extra Finance Unitus is a general lending protocol designed to support a wide range of assets, including stablecoins, blue-chip assets, LSD assets, RWAs, and yield tokens such as sDAI and sUSX. Setting itself apart from other lending protocols, Unitus offers: Integration with USX, allowing users to utilize collaterals from various L1/L2 networks to borrow assets directly on the OP network. This integration enhances cross-chain lending capabilities, providing a flexible and accessible borrowing experience. Immediate access to real yields, enabling users to borrow stablecoins against collateralized RWA assets, thereby optimizing capital efficiency. Decentralized stablecoins: DAI, sUSD, FRAX, etc. USX is now the #6 largest stablecoin by TVL ($5.8m) on Optimism. USX can be minted through an over-collateralized loan on Unitus, via vaults with a fixed rate, or by a 1:1 swap from USDC, USDT, and DAI. Users can utilize wstETH and rETH as collateral to mint USX on Unitus. Additionally, they can use iwstETH, the yield token of Unitus, to mint more USX, enhancing capital efficiency even further. USX is the first stablecoin that offers consistent and top-tier interest rate across all networks supported, including Ethereum, Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, and BSC, through sUSX, the saving version of USX. Integrated with Unitus, users can supply USX or sUSX as collateral to borrow other assets, further improving capital efficiency. 2. Current user base and estimation method 38,987 unique addresses interacted with the smart contracts of dForce protocols, including Unitus and USX.

**Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions**

Steps to increase user interaction Engage actively with Optimism community and launch a series of campaigns to catch the market’s eyeball Launch liquidity mining campaign to 1) reward lending & borrowing activities on Unitus, with a 5% APR incentive in $OP, on top of native yield; 2) reward minting USX through vault with iwstETH as collateral. Partner with more whitelisted protocols for integration opportunities and co-marketing initiatives. 2. Target audience characteristics: Risk-neutral investors: users can assets on Unitus to facilitate various investment strategies (i.e, deposit wstETH to borrow ETH). To further boost lending activities on Unitus, we will provide a target 5% reward in OP on top of native interest and UTS emissions. Users will also be rewarded for providing liquidity for USX and DF on the Optimism network. Risk-averse investors: USX is an ideal hub for conservative investors who prefer consistent and stable yield. Currently, USX offers a stable 15% APY on the Optimism network, with no locking or vesting period. LSD holders: Collateral support for wstETH and rETH is enabled on the Optimism network, allowing users to supply wstETH or rETH as collateral to borrow ETH or other assets. 3. User interaction with Optimism: Unitus : Users can lend to earn or borrow to facilitate various investment strategies. USX : Users can mint USX from USDC, USDT, DAI, iwstETH (vault), or deposit into sUSX to earn 8% APY on their USX holdings. Bridge : seamlessly bridge DF assets (USX, sUSX, DF, UTS) across all supported L1/L2 networks without leaving the platform, with minimized cost (only gas fee apply) 4. Competitors on Optimism: Lending protocols: Aave, Compound, Silo Finance, Extra Finance Decentralized stablecoins: DAI, sUSD, FRAX

Size of request and justification 70,000 OP to be distributed to users who deposit bridged wstETH to dForce. These users will receive a 5% APY incentive in $OP on top of natural interest and UTS emission. The goal is to incentivize $4~8m in TVL. 2. Plan for accomplishing the project (roadmap) Phase I (Week 1~4) Launch Galxe marketing campaign. Incentivize depositing wstETH into Unitus (borrowing stablecoin will be further incentivized with UTS token), as well as minting USX through the iwstETH vault (yield token of wstETH on Unitus) on the USX protocol. Phase II (Week 5~12) Continue to incentivize depositing wstETH into Unitus (borrowing stablecoin will be further incentivized with UTS token), as well as minting USX through the iwstETH vault (yield token of wstETH on Unitus) on the USX protocol. Reach out to new whitelisted protocols and assets for integration opportunities and co-marketing initiatives. 3. OP tokens distribution (percentage and initiatives) Liquidity mining: 70,000 OP - Unitus: 28,000 (40% to incentivize depositing wstETH into Unitus) - USX: 42,000 (60% to incentivize borrowing USX against collateralized iwstETH, the yield token of wstETH) 4. Token distribution timeline Week 1~4: 23,333 OP Week 5~12: 46,667 OP 5. Sustainability post incentives. USX offers a top-tier APY of 8% currently, with no lock-up or vesting period, for users on the Optimism network. This yield is generated by dForce DAO through various approaches, including the spread fee on Unitus, the minting fee of USX, protocol earnings from DeFi strategies, and other RWA and market operation strategies. Unitus will continuously provide emission for whitelisted assets for users on the Optimism network. To date, dForce has distributed 8,573,000 DF tokens and 105,000 UTS tokens, amounting to approximately $700K in dollar value, to continuously incentivize users based on their contribution to the growth and vitality of dForce and the Optimism ecosystem. 6.

**Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions**

Problem solved for Optimism dForce protocols will help DeFi investors find their home on Optimism by earning a stable 8% yield on their USX stablecoin holdings, and further enhance capital efficiency by using sUSX as collateral to facilitate more investment strategies. Alternatively, users can leverage Unitus to lend and borrow a wide range of assets, including LSD, stables, RWAs, to improve their DeFi gains. 2. Value proposition dForce is committed to creating a permission-less liquidity infrastructure for Web3 dApps and build the integrated liquidity layer. All our protocols are open-source, permission-less, and governed by the community. In our continuous effort to innovate and diversify, we aim to connect liquidity across the globe, encompassing both crypto and real-world assets, and spanning the realms of on-chain and off-chain ecosystems. 3. Growth potential for Optimism dForce protocols are fully decentralized, permission-less, and composable, offering a robust and flexible foundation for a wide range of DeFi protocols. Yield, leveraged farming, and fund managers can easily integrate with Unitus, and add USX to their portfolios. This integration enables them to deploy various investment strategies effectively, such as leveraging positions, optimizing yield returns, and managing diversified portfolios. By incorporating USX, investors can enhance their DeFi gains (especially the 8% APY via sUSX) through strategic asset allocation and risk management, benefiting from the stability and liquidity provided by the dForce ecosystem. 4.
