Derive (Formerly Lyra) 

**Name of the Chain:**

Lyra 

**Description of the existing grants program, if applicable.**

Lyra does not currently have a defined grants program but has a long history of supporting projects and integrations through previous grants programs. We hope to enable a new grants program for protocol and technical integrations on the Lyra chain. Previous Lyra grants council Strands Technologies Grant: Strands is fully integrated with Lyra V2, supporting both manual and automated trading. This grant will be used strictly for the development of new features on Lyra Chain and to accelerate rollout timelines.

**Is your chain live?**

yes

**Defined Process:**

Application Screening: - Grant applications will be accepted on a rolling basis. - Initial screening checks for completeness and adherence to basic eligibility criteria. - Grants will focus on two main areas: 1. Liquidity Incentives: Support specific market activities - Market making options, spot, perpetual futures - Liquidity providing for structured products - Liquidity for borrowing and Lending services - AMM deposits 2. Integration Incentives : Encourage developers and protocols to deploy or integrate with Lyra chain targeting technical integrations - Trading tools Analytics tools - Order and Execution Management Systems (OEMS) - Oracles for price feeds and external data providers - DAO tooling (i.e. voting interfaces, potential governor upgrades, etc.) - Account abstraction integrations - NFT projects - Marketing and educational content - Expanded offering of markets and products on Lyra - Chain Cross chain bridges and interoperability protocols - Deployment of tokenized RWAs and yield-bearing assets, particularly stablecoins - Novel applications for derivatives i.e. new margin systems and improvements to capital efficiency Evaluation Criteria: Projects will be assessed based on alignment with Lyra’s strategic priorities and evaluated based on the following criteria: - Potential to drive user engagement and transactions on the Lyra Derivatives Network. - Team capabilities - Technical feasibility - Idea proposed - Impact to Lyra and Optimism ecosystem

**Defined Decision Makers**

Decision-Making Bodies: The Lyra Core team will be responsible for decision making on liquidity incentives and Protocol incentives until such time that Lyra governance approves a body to administer the grants process. Michael Spain: Core Team Member / Co-Founder
Nick Forster: Core Team Member / Co-Founder
Jake Fitzgerald: Core Team Member / Co-Founder
Domonic Romanowski: Core Team Member / Co-Founder

**Defined Mandate:**

Goals and Objectives: - Increased TVL - Increased number of unique users - Increase transaction volume and block space demand on Lyra Chain - Promote competitive liquidity vs centralized venues - Support integrations with protocols on OP mainnet and other OP stack chains - Strengthen technical support, connectivity, security, and robustness of Lyra Chain

**Grant Policies:**

yes

**KYC information requirement:**

yes

**Intent #3B Alignment:**

Onboarding users to Optimism: Lyra is requesting an OP allocation to propel developer growth and activity on the Lyra chain and across the Super Chain through incentive programs, technical upgrades, security upgrades, and more. Lyra will establish the Superchain as the primary hub for derivatives trading activity and the infrastructure built around it, bringing interactions from new and repeat Optimism users and generating demand for Blockspace. Lyra’s CEX-like trading experience unlocks a new demographic of users and creates long-lasting volume and revenue for Optimism. Its on-chain solution directly rivals centralized exchanges in capital efficiency, latency, and UX. Users can seamlessly onboard into the ecosystem, blurring the distinction between on-chain and off-chain. The Lyra protocol unlocks maximum composability by enabling a trustless and verifiable, on-chain risk engine. This enables other protocols or entities to embed Lyra instruments into their strategies and tokenize yield-bearing trades to use as collateral elsewhere. Lyra’s V1 featured more than 10 protocols built on top of the AMM. Lyra Chain’s architecture blows this design space wide open, paving the way for numerous integrations. These integrations have the ability to drive exponential long-term growth and volumes. Lyra V2 Integrations: - Actant : Option trading and risk management software - Strands : Advanced trading software and strategies - Amber Data : Digital asset data infrastructure - Block Scholes : Advanced research and data analytics for trading - Grix : Unified liquidity protocol - D2 Finance : Relative value volatility trading strategies - Stradle.xyz : Options aggregator - Swell : Liquid Restaking - Etherfi : Liquid Restaking - Kelp : Liquid Restaking - Ethena : Synthetic dollar and native yield - Conduit : RAAS

**OP Chain Contribution:**

Current/future commitments: 1. Since launching in December 2023, Lyra has committed to a 15% sequencer profit share with the Optimism Foundation for designing and building the OP stack. - View the Lyra Governance Proposal - All of Lyra sequencer profits accrue to Conduit and have been distributed to the Optimism Collective as of 8/19. View TX hash 2. Lyra agrees to opt into the Optimism Law of Chains — an open neutrality framework designed to govern the Superchain network — as part of the initiative 3. Lyra plans to help advance the Superchain and be deeply involved in decentralizing and strengthening the OP stack, through active participation and contribution in the governance of the Collective 4. Lyra plans to leverage its technical expertise to further contribute to the Collective 5. As the first prominent app chain built on the OP Stack, Lyra is helping and keen to further help the collective understand the needs of this unique (and growing) customer segment. We have participated in several interviews and will continue to share what we have learned with the collective. App chains have different technical and product challenges to generalized L2s which the OP stack needs to accommodate. Lyra's feedback will ensure the collective understands the needs of app chains and gains market share in this growing segment.

**Grants Allocation Framework:**

Lyra will adopt a structured grants allocation framework informed by insights from Optimism Grants and our past grant programs. The framework will allow anyone to propose a grant, with acceptance or rejection requiring majority consensus among the team or voters. The process will be formalized through a governance proposal. Grants will be processed on a rolling basis, following a two-step review process: 1. Initial Intake Review: Grants will be screened for completeness, feasibility, and alignment with Lyra's goals. 2. Interview: Further assessment to ensure the proposed project’s viability and impact. Grant Allocation Categories and Distribution : - Market Makers (35%): Incentivize liquidity provision on spot, options, perpetual futures to enhance market depth. - Protocol Activity (35%): Encourage trading and institutional flow providers to increase transaction volume. Promoting strategy deposits and lending activity. - Technical Integrations (10%) : Support third-party technology vendors, such as SaaS providers and OEMS, that lower barriers to interaction with Lyra and Optimism. - Infrastructure Providers (10%): Fund technical integrations and infrastructure development, including price oracles and volatility feeds. - Audits (10%): Ensure ongoing security and compliance through regular audits. This framework aims to attract market makers, flow providers, and infrastructure partners, driving growth and innovation within the Lyra ecosystem.

**Target Metrics:**

Lyra will prioritize the same metrics used by OP mainnet Grants Council: Growth: TVL in the grantee’s protocol Number of transactions emitting event logs Number of active addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts The total amount of gas fees generated from grantee’s contracts Stickiness: Percentage of retained active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts DAA/MAA ratio Developer Tooling: Number of testnet transactions emitting event logs Number of active developer addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts

**Milestones:**

Milestones for grant recipients will be determined on a case-by-case basis

**Impact Analysis:**

Lyra will evaluate and report impacts of OP grants program based on: 
- Contracts deployed on Lyra
- Sequencer Profit 
- ETH Contributed to the Optimism Collective
- Transactions per day 
- New users on lyra chain
- Grants distributed
- User retention
- Volume
- TVL 

**Token Delivery:**

Lyra will use a multisig to distribute grants to recipients. All grant recipients will be informed of the OP Collective grant policies. 

**Sustainability:**

LDX holders will govern the Lyra Chain and the V2 protocol via the DAO. In order to create a sustainable ecosystem, the DAO earns fees from both the V2 protocol and Lyra Chain.

Fees are generated from multiple sources, all contributing to the Lyra DAO owned security module:

1. Trading Fees: Transactions increasing open interest will incur fees based on the underlying asset's spot price and trade size.
2. Liquidation Fees: Users subject to liquidation pay nominal fees proportional to their account's risk exposure.
3. Interest Rate Spreads: A portion of interest paid by negative cash holders supports the security module.
4. Vault Management Fees: in some cases, Lyra will be able to charge a performance fee for implementing profitable trading strategies and structured products 
5. LDX: once the LDX tokan is live, Lyra may also offer incentives and grants programs in the form of LDX
6. AMM profitability: Lyra governance can allocate protocol owned liquidity to profitable automated trading strategies offered on Lyra Chain
7. Gas Fees: Lyra retains 70% of all As with any rollup, Lyra Chain has an economic structure that fundamentally involves offering blockspace on Layer 2 (L2) and purchasing it on Layer 1 (L1). The structure is as follows:
    - Users - send transactions on the L2 and pay fees to the rollup operator.
    - Lyra Chain - batches transactions and submits them to L1.
    - L1 - the underlying blockchain where transaction data is published.

On-chain gas flows:
- L1 Gas Cost = Gas spent posting the rollup data on L1.
- L2 Gas Received = Gas received by Lyra Chain from users on L2.
- Excess gas = L2 gas received - L1 gas cost

Sequencer profit split:
- 70% to the Lyra DAO (for governing the rollup)
- 15% to Conduit (for operating the off-chain infrastructure)
- 15% to Optimism Foundation (for designing and building the OP stack)

Bootstrapping of Lyra will require extensive resources over time, Lyra will be augmenting $OP with significant $LDX and $USDC rewards. This multifaceted approach ensures sustainable liquidity and trading volume within the Lyra ecosystem
