Derive (Formerly Lyra) 

**Name of the Chain:**

Derive (formerly Lyra) 

**Description of the existing grants program, if applicable.**

Derive does not currently have a defined grants program but has a long history of supporting projects and integrations through previous grants programs. We hope to enable a new grants program for protocol and technical integrations on the Derive chain. Previous Lyra grants council Strands Technologies Grant: Strands is fully integrated with Derive, supporting both manual and automated trading. This grant will be used strictly for the development of new features on Derive Chain and to accelerate rollout timelines.

**Defined Process:**

Application Screening: - Grant applications will be accepted on a rolling basis. - Initial screening checks for completeness and adherence to basic eligibility criteria. - Grants will focus on two main areas: 1. Liquidity Incentives: Support specific market activities - Market-making options, spot, perpetual futures - Liquidity providing for structured products - Liquidity for borrowing and Lending services - AMM deposits 2. Integration Incentives : Encourage developers and protocols to deploy or integrate with Derive chain targeting technical integrations - Trading tools Analytics tools - Order and Execution Management Systems (OEMS) - Oracles for price feeds and external data providers - DAO tooling (i.e. voting interfaces, potential governor upgrades, etc.) - Account abstraction integrations - NFT projects - Marketing and educational content - Expanded offering of markets and products on Derive - Chain Cross chain bridges and interoperability protocols - Deployment of tokenized RWAs and yield-bearing assets, particularly stablecoins - Novel applications for derivatives i.e. new margin systems and improvements to capital efficiency Evaluation Criteria: Projects will be assessed based on alignment with Derive's strategic priorities and evaluated based on the following criteria: - Potential to drive user engagement and transactions on the Derive L2. - Team capabilities - Technical feasibility - Idea proposed - Impact to Derive and Optimism ecosystem

**Defined Decision Makers**

Decision-Making Bodies: The Derive Core team will be responsible for decision making on liquidity incentives and Protocol incentives until such time that Derive governance approves a body to administer the grants process. Michael Spain: Core Team Member / Co-Founder Nick Forster: Core Team Member / Co-Founder Jake Fitzgerald: Core Team Member / Co-Founder Domonic Romanowski: Core Team Member / Co-Founder

**Defined Mandate:**

**KYC information requirement:**

yes

**Intent #3B Alignment:**

Onboarding users to Optimism: Derive is requesting an OP allocation to propel developer growth and activity on the Derive chain and across the Super Chain through incentive programs, technical upgrades, security upgrades, and more. Derive will establish the Superchain as the primary hub for derivatives trading activity and the infrastructure built around it, bringing interactions from new and repeat Optimism users and generating demand for Blockspace. Derive's CEX-like trading experience unlocks a new demographic of users and creates long-lasting volume and revenue for Optimism. Its on-chain solution directly rivals centralized exchanges in capital efficiency, latency, and UX. Users can seamlessly onboard into the ecosystem, blurring the distinction between on-chain and off-chain. The Derive protocol unlocks maximum composability by enabling a trustless and verifiable, on-chain risk engine. This enables other protocols or entities to embed Derive instruments into their strategies and tokenize yield-bearing trades to use as collateral elsewhere. Derive's V1 featured more than 10 protocols built on top of the AMM. Derive Chain’s architecture blows this design space wide open, paving the way for numerous integrations. These integrations have the ability to drive exponential long-term growth and volumes. Derive Integrations: - Actant : Option trading and risk management software - Strands : Advanced trading software and strategies - Amber Data : Digital asset data infrastructure - Block Scholes : Advanced research and data analytics for trading - Grix : Unified liquidity protocol - D2 Finance : Relative value volatility trading strategies - Stradle.xyz : Options aggregator - Swell : Liquid Restaking - Etherfi : Liquid Restaking - Kelp : Liquid Restaking - Ethena : Synthetic dollar and native yield - Conduit : RAAS

**OP Chain Contribution:**

Current/future commitments: 1. Since launching in December 2023, Derive has committed to a 15% sequencer profit share with the Optimism Foundation for designing and building the OP stack. - View the Derive Governance Proposal - All of Derive sequencer profits accrue to Conduit and have been distributed to the Optimism Collective as of 8/19. View TX hash 2. Derive agrees to opt into the Optimism Law of Chains — an open neutrality framework designed to govern the Superchain network — as part of the initiative 3. Derive plans to help advance the Superchain and be deeply involved in decentralizing and strengthening the OP stack, through active participation and contribution in the governance of the Collective 4. Derive plans to leverage its technical expertise to further contribute to the Collective 5. As the first prominent app chain built on the OP Stack, Derive is helping and keen to further help the collective understand the needs of this unique (and growing) customer segment. We have participated in several interviews and will continue to share what we have learned with the collective. App chains have different technical and product challenges to generalized L2s which the OP stack needs to accommodate. Derive's feedback will ensure the collective understands the needs of app chains and gains market share in this growing segment.

**Grants Allocation Framework:**

Derive will adopt a structured grants allocation framework informed by insights from Optimism Grants and our past grant programs. The framework will allow anyone to propose a grant, with acceptance or rejection requiring majority consensus among the team or voters. The process will be formalized through a governance proposal. Grants will be processed on a rolling basis, following a two-step review process: 1. Initial Intake Review: Grants will be screened for completeness, feasibility, and alignment with Derive's goals. 2. Interview: Further assessment to ensure the proposed project’s viability and impact. Grant Allocation Categories and Distribution : - Market Makers (35%): Incentivize liquidity provision on spot, options, perpetual futures to enhance market depth. - Protocol Activity (35%): Encourage trading and institutional flow providers to increase transaction volume. Promoting strategy deposits and lending activity. - Technical Integrations (10%) : Support third-party technology vendors, such as SaaS providers and OEMS, that lower barriers to interaction with Derive and Optimism. - Infrastructure Providers (10%): Fund technical integrations and infrastructure development, including price oracles and volatility feeds. - Audits (10%): Ensure ongoing security and compliance through regular audits. This framework aims to attract market makers, flow providers, and infrastructure partners, driving growth and innovation within the Derive ecosystem.

**Milestones:**

Milestones for grant recipients will be determined on a case-by-case basis

**Impact Analysis:**

Derive will evaluate and report impacts of OP grants program based on: 
- Contracts deployed on Derive
- Sequencer Profit 
- ETH Contributed to the Optimism Collective
- Transactions per day 
- New users on Derive chain
- Grants distributed
- User retention
- Volume
- TVL 

**Token Delivery:**

Derive will use a multisig to distribute grants to recipients. All grant recipients will be informed of the OP Collective grant policies. 

**Sustainability:**

LDX holders will govern the Derive Chain and the V2 protocol via the DAO. In order to create a sustainable ecosystem, the DAO earns fees from both the V2 protocol and Derive Chain.

Fees are generated from multiple sources, all contributing to the Derive DAO owned security module:

1. Trading Fees: Transactions increasing open interest will incur fees based on the underlying asset's spot price and trade size.
2. Liquidation Fees: Users subject to liquidation pay nominal fees proportional to their account's risk exposure.
3. Interest Rate Spreads: A portion of interest paid by negative cash holders supports the security module.
4. Vault Management Fees: in some cases, Derive will be able to charge a performance fee for implementing profitable trading strategies and structured products 
5. LDX: once the LDX tokan is live, Derive may also offer incentives and grants programs in the form of LDX
6. AMM profitability: Derive governance can allocate protocol owned liquidity to profitable automated trading strategies offered on Derive Chain
7. Gas Fees: Derive retains 70% of all As with any rollup, Derive Chain has an economic structure that fundamentally involves offering blockspace on Layer 2 (L2) and purchasing it on Layer 1 (L1). The structure is as follows:
    - Users - send transactions on the L2 and pay fees to the rollup operator.
    - Derive Chain - batches transactions and submits them to L1.
    - L1 - the underlying blockchain where transaction data is published.

On-chain gas flows:
- L1 Gas Cost = Gas spent posting the rollup data on L1.
- L2 Gas Received = Gas received by Derive Chain from users on L2.
- Excess gas = L2 gas received - L1 gas cost

Sequencer profit split:
- 70% to the Derive DAO (for governing the rollup)
- 15% to Conduit (for operating the off-chain infrastructure)
- 15% to Optimism Foundation (for designing and building the OP stack)

Bootstrapping of Derive will require extensive resources over time, Derive will be augmenting $OP with significant $LDX and $USDC rewards. This multifaceted approach ensures sustainable liquidity and trading volume within the Derive ecosystem
