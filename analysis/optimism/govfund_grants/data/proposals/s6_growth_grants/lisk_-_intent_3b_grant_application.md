**Intent #3B Alignment:**

Lisk Proposal for Stablecoin Adoption [Season 6 Intent #3B] Summary Lisk is dedicated to accelerating the onboarding of the next billion users to Web3 by focusing on real-world applications in emerging markets. Our proposal aims to support and enhance the stablecoin ecosystem within the Optimism Superchain, thereby providing crucial financial tools to populations that need blockchain infrastructure the most. We intend to support various issuers and currencies, including yield-bearing stablecoins, to foster a robust, multi-currency ecosystem. Plan 1. Support for the Two Most Liquid USD Stablecoins Tether (USDT) Deployment: USDT contract on Lisk. Rationale: USDT is widely used in emerging markets and serves as the primary on/off-ramp option. Circle (USDC) Deployment: USDC contract on Lisk (pending deployment for all Superchain members by OP). Rationale: USDC is the most popular trading pair in DeFi and crucial for trading against RWAs. Liquidity Incentives Lisk will incentivize liquidity for USDT and USDC pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Velodrome and Oku.Trade. 2. Multi-Currency Ecosystem Initial Currency Support Partners/Targets Tokenized Euros (EUR): EURC from Circle EURA from Angle Tokenized South African Rand (ZAR): FZAR by FiveWest, a local partner of Circle ZARCoin Tokenized Indonesian Rupiahs (IDR) IDRT Others, as part of our Partnership with the Government of Indonesia 3. Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Yield-bearing stablecoins represent an innovative development in RWAs. We foresee their widespread adoption and plan to support the following: stUSD from Angle Yield Source: Tokenized US Treasury Bills and leverage demand in Morpho lending markets. USDM from Mountain Yield Source: US Treasury Bills sUSDe from Ethena Yield Source: Cash-and-carry trades on BTC and ETH. 4. FZAR / USDC Pool on Lisk The FZAR / USDC pool aims to provide South Africans with a yield opportunity from exposure to ZAR/USD. The pool will benefit from swap fees, interest airdrops and LSK incentives, leveraging FiveWest’s client base involved in South African arbitrage. We expect this pool to offer very attractive returns (30%+) and grow to $300k within several months.

**OP Chain Contribution:**

Contribution to the Collective Despite being one of the newest L2s (having launched its Mainnet in May 2024), Lisk has already become the 4th largest Superchain Member thanks to its long-standing community since 2016. Source: L2Beat (as of July 22, 2024) This information is not reflected in the Superchain Health Dashboard since this data is currently hosted on L2Beat, and the Dashboard looks at DefiLlama for TVL data. Implementation Plan for Stablecoins 1. Deployment of Stablecoins Deploy USDT - Complete Deploy USDC - Planned for August 2024. 2. Liquidity Incentives Seed initial liquidity / launch liquidity mining programs on Velodrome / Oku.Trade for USDT and USDC. Monitor and adjust incentives to ensure optimal liquidity. 3. Multi-Currency Support (non-USD stablecoins) Integrate EURC, EURA, and FZAR . Launch targeted marketing campaigns to drive adoption. 4. Yield-Bearing Options Launch stUSD and sUSDe. Promote these options through liquidity incentives and DeFi integrations. 5. FZAR / USDC Pool Growth Establish the pool with initial liquidity from Lisk. Implement a growth strategy to reach $300k in TVL. Provide ongoing support and incentives to maintain high returns and liquidity. We believe our proposal aligns with Optimism’s mission to foster blockchain adoption and financial inclusion. By supporting a diverse range of stablecoins and yield-bearing options, we aim to build a comprehensive ecosystem that meets the needs of emerging markets. We seek the Optimism community's support to realize this vision, enhancing financial accessibility and stability for millions of users. We look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the Optimism Superchain and drive forward the adoption of stablecoins in emerging markets. Update - 29 July 2024 Please note: As a member of the Superchain, we contribute 15% of our sequencer revenue to the Optimism Collective, as part of our commitment to the Law of Chains. We do not have any other revenue share agreement with Optimism at either the Foundation or the Governance level at this time.

**Grants Allocation Framework:**

Scoring and Ranking: Projects are scored based on the evaluation criteria. Scores are used to rank projects and determine funding priorities. Milestone-Based Disbursement: Funds are disbursed based on the achievement of predefined milestones. Each milestone is associated with specific deliverables and timelines. Regular progress reports are required to ensure accountability and transparency. Update - 29 July 2024 Please note: We estimate the grants to be distributed roughly in equal/comparable proportions to the following categories at this time: a) Our existing programs that were highlighted in the application: For example, the Lisk Grants Program which is an open-ended competitive grants program with public applications that we administer in waves b) Future ecosystem participants as part of our active BD operations: They are made up of both outbound projects that we reach out to and inbound projects that we meet at events, reach out to us directly or are introduced to us through our network.

**Target Metrics:**

We prioritize the same metrics as OP Mainnet Grants Council, with a higher emphasis placed on the top three currently (underlined below to highlight their increased priority) Growth: TVL in the grantee’s protocol Number of transactions emitting event logs Number of active addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts The total amount of gas fees generated from grantee’s contracts Stickiness: Percentage of retained active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts DAA/MAA ratio Developer Tooling: Number of testnet transactions emitting event logs Number of active developer addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts

**Milestones:**

Milestones are determined on a case by case basis. Projects can join the grant program at many different stages, but in general we expect continuous growth towards the agreed milestone goals.

**Impact Analysis:**

- Progress reports
- Surveys and feedback
- Number of new projects
- User growth
- Total Value Locked
- Transaction volume
- Regional growth

UPDATE - 29 July 2024:
We commit to at least one formal report back to the Grants Council summarizing how the Lisk program deployed its funding, highlighting lessons learned and the impact of the grants given as applicable.

**Sustainability:**

- We incentivize and heavily encourage participants to launch their own tokens so that they are rooted in the Superchain
- Through our internal resources and external stakeholders, we will provide guidance and support so that each protocol can create a viable business model, ideally through their tokens, and focus on making their protocols self-sustainable (see next question for details)
