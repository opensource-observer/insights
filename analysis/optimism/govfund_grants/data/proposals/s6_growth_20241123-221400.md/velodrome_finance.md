- **Do you have a code audit for your project?:** Yes, it can be viewed at https://velodrome.finance/security
- **Please briefly answer all project details questions:** Velodrome is a liquidity marketplace that not just lets individuals swap tokens and liquidity providers facilitate these swaps in a value-generating way but also allows token issuers and projects to attract capital and attention while bootstrapping their treasuries. It is based on a wholly novel primitive and entirely rebuilt from that standard, making it stand alone as a major pillar of DeFi onchain—and its team’s dedication to Superchain has pioneered a new model of ecosystem support that has spawned imitators across the industry. Our team has solicited grants in the past to help us achieve our goal of making Optimism the best place for projects to do buisness. The backdrop here: competition in the L2 environment has increased dramatically in recent months. Programs like Arbitrum STIP are actively luring projects and user activity away from Optimism and the OP Stack. Arbitrum has distributed ~$175,000,000 over a period of roughly 3 months primarily on direct liquidity incentives, just as Optimism has reduced incentives available for its ecosystem Other Layer 2s and EVM chains are all running aggressive airdrop farming and incentive campaigns (on top of direct grants to builders) that are attracting significant liquidity and engagement. This increase in competition has also coincided with a general ramping down of competitive incentives on platforms like Velodrome. The OP ecosystem has been fighting this battle without its most effective incentive program running at full steam. As one of the first points of contact for new projects considering expanding to Layer 2’s or new chains, Velodrome has seen the impact of these incentive programs on our ability to onboard new projects and their users to Optimism. Previously, expanding to OP Mainnet was a priority for most projects, but now many projects often choose to prioritize other chains. The results of RPGF3, with only 5% of the total rewards flowing to top application layer projects have further amplified this effect. The Optimism Foundation has acknowledged this gap and taken steps to remedy it with its Onchain Summer initiative. However, the project leads concede that this is just an initial step toward what will be necessary stimulus to cement Superchain as the primary place for DeFi onchain. Velodrome has mostly open-source contracts, although a selection of contracts and other portions of the codebase are governed by various business licenses to protect Velodrome (and Optimism’s) ability to meet operating objectives. There are trading fees but the development company does not receive any preprogrammed fee share. Being a dex, we are highly composable with other defi protocols and are purpose-built to this end. We have numerous integrations across the Optimism ecosystem. We have a substantial track record in excellence in both executing and reporting on our grants.

# Market Analysis:

- **Please briefly answer all market analysis questions:** Velodrome has typically been compared with Uniswap, Curve, and other AMM dexes, but we see our addressable market as far exceeding this and as such don’t see them as note-for-note competitors. To the extent that our fee economy competes with them for liquidity providers, this is the case. Our incentives structure puts us up against Convex and much of the greater Curve ecosystem but also against bootstrapping and treasury management projects such as Fjord. Our current user base is roughly 120k MAU, as measured by Token Terminal, which is approximately 10% of the site’s estimation of OP Mainnet in total. Number of protocols onboarded is 80+ to date.

# Grant's impact

- **Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions:** This is part of a months-long project to increase user activity and retention systemwide on Optimism. Our target audience is users and protocols.Here, the idea is to get them more fully engaged with Optimism: the former by locking positions and voting weekly, and the latter by building directly on OP Mainnet as a jumping off point for the Superchain. The goal is to make adding incentives and having an OP mainnet strategy more appealing to these organizations in the midst of a lot of competition for mindshare. This will result in attracting more users interested in these  We discuss competition elsewhere. We address competitors elsewhere in this application.
- **Full list of the project’s labeled contracts:** Grant funds will be delivered here: 0x3b5a0Fc12f8fd8B26d251F28258D1d172F930f8A This multisig will then call notify reward on Velodrome rewards contracts for eligible pools. These rewards will then be distributed to voters in exchange for a greater value in Velo emissions to attract liquidity providers. These exact contracts may change, but for example: 0xc78d4395f6ed4e7037faffe634b7b3f8af376a8d is the incentive contract for wstETH/WETH. A full list of eligible pools can be provided.

# Metrics improved by OP incentives

- **Select the metric specified in the mission request:** (Intent 3 Growth) TVL in grantee’s protocol
- **Fill out your metric objective:** Increase TVL for YBA's on Velodrome

# Budget and Plan

- **Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions:** Velodrome’s 1.9X incentive multiplier, the highest on Optimism, paired with concentrated liquidity pools for trading execution, makes it an ideal platform for YBA asset projects to build and retain liquidity within the ecosystem. In our efforts to onboard YBA projects to Optimism, we have learned that despite some teams having strong interest in increasing their presence on Optimism, they require a strong multiplier on their incentives or additional support (e.g., OP incentives) to pursue an effective deployment strategy, as deep liquidity is critical for their network integrations. This is largely due to the prevalence of very large incentive/farming campaigns being run on other Layer 2’s like Arbitrum. The comparison metrics can vary with market conditions but as of recently Velodrome held a significant multiplier advantage for incentives over other alternatives on Optimism. This makes the OP spent on Velodrome much more efficient. The program proposed in this application is designed to support YBA providers by leveraging Velodrome’s leading incentive multiplier and offer tailored strategies for liquidity building and deployment on Optimism. We would target distributing 10k OP a week to YBA trading pairs on our Dex. These would be matched according to the incentives and trading fees so that we are incentivizing the most productive LSTs. This would yield around a 20 week program with our proposed grant amount. In terms of sustainability, TVL for YBA's is reflexive we believe. As more TVL comes to optimism, applications like lending markets or trading platforms integrate YBAs as collateral options. This deeper liquidity allows for greater lending limits and more defi activity overall. We work closely with lending protocols on Optimism and are excited about the addition of Moonwell one of our superchain partners to the ecosystem. By coordinating with them we believe we can create a whole host of use cases for YBA's so liquidity will remain as trading fees and other activity will incentivize it to stay. We also believe as we work more closely with teams and show them the impact of incentivizing on Optimism, we can attract continuing incentive programs after the grant has expired. Accountability can be found in our milestones below.

# Optimism relationship

- **Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions:** A goal for Optimism is to be the center of DeFi onchain, as reflected in more active developers and smart contracts as well as more active users performing regular defi activities. Velodrome is one of the primary points of contact in onboarding both developers and users, and, what’s more, it is a focus for frequent, reliable **activity in these areas as a trusted provider of services to both projects and users. Velodrome’s value to projects is well documented, but less appreciated: Velodrome’s end users and veVELO voters are known to be some of the best-informed participants in all DeFi, particularly on Optimism. Why? Because they have to be; each week, they visit Velodrome to see what new projects have listed on Optimism and judge whether these projects would be a good recipient of votes. This cultivates a community highly up to date on the latest happenings on OP Mainnet and elsewhere on Superchain. We are fully committed to building on Superchain, being arguably. Unlike other projects that have claimed a ‘native’ presence on Optimism, we expend considerable resources not looking to deploy elsewhere but making Optimism the place for other projects to deploy. We only see ourselves succeeding if Optimism succeeds; this is the bet we made over two years ago.
