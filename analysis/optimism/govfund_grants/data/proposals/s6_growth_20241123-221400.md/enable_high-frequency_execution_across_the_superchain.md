# Project Details

- **If this is a resubmission from a declined Application, please provide the link to the previous Application, and briefly explain the main areas of improvement. If not please write (N/A):** N/A
- **Do you have a code audit for your project?:** No
- **Please briefly answer all project details questions:** Brief description of the project and what it aims to achieve: Aori is an orderbook protocol currently live on Arbitrum, Blast, and Base, facilitating high-frequency on-chain trading which allows anyone to tap into DeFi-exclusive market makers and solvers that quote native DeFi liquidity with low latencies. Aori’s team has strong backgrounds in institutional crypto market making, DeFi strategies, and MEV, influencing the design philosophies driving protocol integrations, interfaces and products. Aori will provide dApps across the ecosystem with the tools they require to access a larger liquidity network, ultimately providing all Superchain users with better pricing. Aori aims to increase the total volume (and TVL) being done across the Superchain as high-frequency trading firms, searchers, and even regular end-users are incentivized to gaslessly make orders for any token market on Optimism. Success potential: Aori has launched on Arbitrum, Blast, and most recently, Base. We intend on rolling out to more of the Superchain, including Mode - Optimism and the Superchain ecosystem is a high priority for our team given the high-quality community and teams currently operating within those spaces. We are likely to succeed because our retail-facing product (Swap UI, https://app.aori.io) has shown our pricing to be superior to the vast majority of top DEXes or aggregators, including Uniswap, 1inch and Matcha. Given that our contracts are easy to deploy cross-EVM, our deployment to Optimism is easily executable as they have been for previous chains and we currently plan to deploy sometime in Q3. Mission alignment: Aori is aligned with this Mission because we plan to launch within the next 6 months and are currently focused on attracting a wider retail user base for our dApp to make swapping extremely user-friendly. We have also spent the past 6 months+ meeting with development teams across the Ethereum ecosystem to discuss the value proposition behind our product. To date, we are in the process of integrating with several projects, as well as institutions looking to onboard into DeFi, enabling them to do HFT trading onchain. Novelty: Aori is unique because we are solving for maker flow. What this means is that we want to get people to post asks to our orderbook from a wide variety of liquidity sources so that we can rebalance prices across different environments. Simply put, we want to abstract away a lot of logic for developers and retail users alike to make DeFi more hassle-free. We're also highly composable for any EVM environment (with non-EVM chains like Fuel Network and Solana on our roadmap) as we want to offer high performance for all takers on Aori in the form of CEX-adjacent low-latency and extremely competitive pricing. We are also learning from the mistakes of previous DeFi protocols in providing support early on in our integration process for any party so that the experience of working with/using Aori as a developer is just as seamless and time-efficient as it is for our retail users. Will the project be open source? Yes, our project is currently open source. Free or fee-based for end users? Our service is fee-based as we charge 0.03% (3bps) on all successfully filled traders. Making orders is gasless so users are not charged anything unless they receive the assets they expected to receive at the quoted price. Is it composable with other projects on Optimism? How? Yes, we allow any liquidity source on Optimism to integrate with us for better execution. The same applies to the Superchain and any EVM-compatible project as our ultimate goal is to allow volume to flow freely between fragmented liquidity environments without having to leave our site. We guide every partner of ours through the integration process. In doing so, we also want to help dApps and developers concerned with performant execution to achieve low latency, high-frequency transaction output through Aori.

# Market Analysis:

- **Please briefly answer all market analysis questions:** Competitors and differentiation We do not think of ourselves as having many competitors because we are technically composable with any DeFi protocol, including DEXes, DEX aggregators, Lending protocols, Vaults, Perpetual protocols etc. However, our most direct competitors are Uniswap/Uniswap X and Matcha. All DEXes in some respects can be considered competitors because we also have a Swap UI, however, this Swap UI quotes an aggregate amount on assets much like Matcha, making DEX aggregators a stronger competitor to us than DEXes, as we can aggregate both. Despite this, we are NOT a DEX aggregator either. We are a protocol concerned with enabling high-frequency execution of transactions on chain, for any type of swaps or combination of swaps. Current user base and estimation method In the process of integration a handful of major funds and prop shops.

# Grant's impact

- **Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions:** We will seek to coordinate extensive co-marketing efforts with the Optimism Foundation as well as its associated Superchai partners and projects. Our primary, institutional target audience wants high-frequency execution, at a low cost and low latency. Our retail audience wants a CEX-like experience where they won't have to worry about gas, high fees, or bridging. Through our Swap UI and backend integration(s) with partners deployed on Optimism. None direct.

# Optimism relationship

- **Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions:** roFragmentation of liquidity across the Superchain, as well as cost and latency when trading assets High-frequency execution, essentially Binance onchain Growing volume on Optimism as well as TVL long-term as we iterate the Aori contract We understand the value proposition of the Superchain, and a number of chains we want to work with e.g. Base, Mode. Are members of the Superchain family so Optimism's strong dev and retail community is a significant reason for us to prioritize Optimism mainnet. Not yet deployed on Optimism, but omnichain as Aori is live on other networks (EVM) but later cross-chain.
