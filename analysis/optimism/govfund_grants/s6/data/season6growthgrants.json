Developers have started building on top of existing frameworks and created easier way to create Frames, but still only for developers and technical people alike. To put this into perspective and provide an example for the difficulty of creating Frames: no matter how easy to use a specific framework is, you still have to host the Frame yourself on a VPS (server) or similar hosting solution. The growth of Frames is severely hindered by the lack of a UI first solution to build these Frames that also integrates hosting under the hood w/out the user having to do _anything_ extra.\n\nFrameTrain has made that possible, but the road ahead has just begun. The next steps are to integrate more templates (achieved through FrameHack and this proposal) and to make the existence of our solution known to current users, they will in turn share these new and useful type of interactions with non Farcaster users (either on platforms like Twitter, or direct sharing with their friends).\n\nWe envision a 10x growth of the Farcaster protocol through a solution like FrameTrain. This is not a downplayed, nor an exaggerated factor of growth. The protocol has grown in revenue 10x already (from under ~$200,000 to over ~$2M revenue) after the launch of Frames (given all current barriers of entry noted above). We also see a considerable amount of new accounts & transactions on Optimism and related OP Stack chains, each for various reasons. \n\nSources of transactions for the Optimism chain\n- Registering a FID (creating an account)\n- Buying storage units (needed to be able to cast/react/follow on Farcaster)\n\nSources of transactions for Base, Zora & related chains\n- Minting (supported natively in Frames)\n- Swapping (through Frames that enable that)\n- Attestations (through the Ethereum Attestation Service)\n- Various contract interactions\n\n\nMETRICS OBJECTIVE\n1 —— With ~1,150 users registering on Farcaster every 24 hours ( https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x00000000fc04c910a0b5fea33b03e0447ad0b0aa), we expect this number to at least double after FrameHack #2 ends and FrameTrain exits stealth mode (i.e. starts outreach and marketing, which is outside of this proposal and the sole responsibility of FrameTrain to do).\n\n2 —— Given that Base is the preferred network on Warpcast and clients alike for making transactions, we estimate that 0.5% of all Base transactions will come from Frames created on FrameTrain, which means around 1,600 tx per day.

The primary metrics for assessment will include TVL, transaction volumes, user engagement, and protocol adoption rates. Specific milestones will serve as benchmarks for success.\n\nReporting:\n\nTo ensure transparency and accountability, the following reporting mechanisms will be implemented:\n\nMonthly Reports: Detailed monthly reports will be provided, outlining the progress of the grants program, the utilization of funds, and the achievement of key milestones. These reports will include data on TVL growth, transaction volumes, and other relevant KPIs.\n\nReal-Time Dashboard: A real-time dashboard will be available for stakeholders to monitor the grants program's performance continuously. This dashboard will provide up-to-date information on TVL, transaction volumes, and other key metrics, ensuring full transparency.\n\nExample of Reporting:\n\nFor reference, we have implemented similar reporting mechanisms for the Arbitrum STIP grant for liquidity incentivization grant. An example of this reporting can be found bellow. This example showcases our commitment to transparency and detailed reporting. https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/frax-finance-bi-weekly-update-final-update/22960 "

These could include technical deliverables, user engagement metrics, or partnership developments.\nKPIs: Establish KPIs that align with the goals of the grant program, such as the number of active users, the degree of decentralization achieved, or the scalability of the solution developed.\nCommunity Feedback: Incorporate metrics that capture community feedback and sentiment, as these can be strong indicators of the project's alignment with the broader ecosystem’s needs.\n\n2. Continuous Monitoring and Reporting\nRegular Updates: Grantees should provide regular updates, typically monthly or quarterly, that outline their progress toward the defined milestones and KPIs. These updates could be in the form of written reports, video presentations, or public blog posts.\nPeer Review: Involve the broader community or a designated peer review panel in assessing the updates provided by grantees. This adds a layer of transparency and accountability.\nData-Driven Insights: Utilize data analytics tools to track the performance of the projects. This could include monitoring the project's blockchain transactions, user activity, or other relevant data points.\n\n3. Retrospective Reports\nFinal Report Submission: At the conclusion of the project, grantees are required to submit a comprehensive final report. This report should detail the outcomes achieved, challenges faced, and lessons learned. It should also include an analysis of the impact metrics initially set.\nImpact Analysis: Assess the project's overall impact on the ecosystem by comparing the outcomes with the initially defined goals. This includes evaluating the project's sustainability, its contribution to the community, and any unforeseen benefits or drawbacks.\nPublic Retrospective: Consider publishing a retrospective analysis for public viewing. This not only increases transparency but also provides insights to other projects and the broader community on what worked and what didn’t.\n\n4. Post-Grantee Evaluation\nFollow-Up Evaluation: Conduct follow-up evaluations at set intervals after the project's completion to assess long-term impacts and sustainability.\nEcosystem Integration: Evaluate how well the project has integrated into the broader ecosystem and whether it has continued to develop or inspired similar initiatives.\n\n5. Transparent Reporting\nAnnual Impact Report: Compile the results from all funded projects into an annual impact report. This report should be shared with the community and stakeholders, highlighting the successes, challenges, and overall contribution of the grants program.\nPublic Dashboards: Consider creating a public dashboard that tracks ongoing projects in real time, showing key metrics, milestones achieved, and current status. This enhances transparency and allows the community to engage with and support grantees. "

Initial Intake Review: Grants will be screened for completeness, feasibility, and alignment with Derive's goals. 2. Interview: Further assessment to ensure the proposed project’s viability and impact. Grant Allocation Categories and Distribution : - Market Makers (35%): Incentivize liquidity provision on spot, options, perpetual futures to enhance market depth. - Protocol Activity (35%): Encourage trading and institutional flow providers to increase transaction volume. Promoting strategy deposits and lending activity. - Technical Integrations (10%) : Support third-party technology vendors, such as SaaS providers and OEMS, that lower barriers to interaction with Derive and Optimism. - Infrastructure Providers (10%): Fund technical integrations and infrastructure development, including price oracles and volatility feeds. - Audits (10%): Ensure ongoing security and compliance through regular audits.
