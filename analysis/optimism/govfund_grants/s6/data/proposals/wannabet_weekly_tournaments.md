WannaBet Weekly Tournaments 1. Brief project description: WannaBet Weekly Tournaments is an onchain social game on the Superchain that engages users through a weekly tournament. Every week, non-sybil verified users will be distributed Tournament Tokens to participate in a game to bet others to accumulate as many tokens as possible. Tokens will not be tradable and only can be accumulated through bets on the platform. Winners every week will receive OP as incentives for participating Leaderboard with weekly rewards for top performers Farcaster integration for enhanced social features Onchain activity on Contracts on OP stack chains Goal: By attracting lots of attention to an app with users, more developers will build apps in the OP ecosystem 2. Success potential: Regular weekly engagement encourages consistent participation Sybil-resistant design ensures fair play Low barrier to entry (free tokens) attracts diverse user base Scalable structure accommodates community growth Incentives align with ecosystem growth and learning objectives 3. Mission alignment: Attracts builders through gamified attention Fosters community via competitions and social features Generates consistent onchain transactions, contributing to chain utility 4. Novelty: To my knowledge, no other P2P betting platform exists Weekly tournament structure Leverages Farcaster for social-first developer onboarding 5. Open Source, Pricing, and Composability: Fully open source: All code and documentation publicly available on GitHub 0.0002 ETH tx fee to prevent tx spamming Anybody can build using the WannaBet smart contracts e.g. creating their own front end, creating AI agents as judges

Size of request and justification Requesting 35,000 OP tokens to fund user incentives to use the application, 0 OP will go to the team Plan for accomplishing the project (roadmap) Month 1: Develop WannaBet token contract and prepare marketing and promotion materials Month 2: Launch Tournaments Planned schedule of distribution . This schedule is subject to change based on the validated learnings running the tournaments. WannaBet Team also will evaluate wallets for sybil activity and only distribute to honest participants The schedule is designed to drive attention early on and reduce rewards but continue to incentivize continued participation throughout the year and create habits to pull users away from web 2 betting solutions and solidify new users on the Superchain. Distribution method can be changed based on the tournament week (e.g. 0.5 OP per bet won vs top 3 winners get 250 OP each) OP tokens distribution (percentages and initiatives) 100% Incentives Sustainability post-incentives Post-initial incentives, WannaBet Weekly Tournaments will sustain itself as we will have built a user base and habits where users are betting on the platform without the need for incentives. Additional accountability info Dune Dashboard for Tracking Analytics Public Github Repository Weekly Rewards Distributions and Analytics will be published Farcaster and the OP Forum

Problem solved for Optimism User attraction and retention (which in turn attracts app devs) Consistent on-chain activity generation By gamifying development and learning, we create a compelling reason for builders to build apps on OP stack chains Value proposition WannaBet Weekly Tournaments offers: Engaging, low-stakes environment for users to learn and experiment on Optimism Regular onchain transactions through weekly tournaments Platform for other Optimism projects to showcase and attract developers Community-building tool that fosters collaboration and healthy competition Data-driven insights into user interests within the ecosystem Growth potential for Optimism WannaBet Weekly Tournaments drives growth by: Attracting new users through gamified tournaments Increasing transaction volume via regular tournament activities Expanding the ecosystem's network effect Commitment to building on Optimism Will deploy this contracts existing on Base but on OP.
