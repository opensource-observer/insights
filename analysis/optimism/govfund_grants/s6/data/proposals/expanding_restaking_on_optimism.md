We are working on creating a publicly accessible dashboard to show rewards spent from the previous grant ( https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-to-vote-making-optimism-a-primary-home-of-liquid-staked-eth/7456) and the current one

**Please briefly answer all project details questions**

Brief description of the project and what it aims to achieve: Kelp (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocols built on top of the Eigen Layer. USD 900 Mn+ TVL in few weeks post launch. 40 Mn+ liquidity across mainnet DEXs 45+ DeFi integrations across Pendle, Curve, Balancer, Maverik Native restaking and bridging Live across Optimism, Arbitrum and other leading L2 Kelp’s smart contracts can be reviewed on its Github page - https://github.com/Kelp-DAO/ and its docs page - https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/ Success potential: KelpDAO’s founder’s and core team members have previously worked on building and scaling, Stader Labs (https://www.staderlabs.com/) , a liquid staking protocol with 600 Mn+ TVL across 6 chains including Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, Hedera etc.. Integrations with 50+ DeFi protocols and ecosystem partners including Aave, Compound, MetaMask, Ledger etc. Over 90k users stake with Stader Stader’s liquid staking smart contracts across all chains can be reviewed on our Github page - https://github.com/stader-labs. Mission alignment: Novelty : Kelp launched its native liquid restaking solution on Optimism on 16th of April, 2024 and has been growing steadily. Users can natively restake their ETH on Optimism or bridge their restaked ETH (rsETH) to Optimism from any Layer 2 network and Ethereum. We have also partnered with leading protocols such as Balancer, Velodrome, Extra Finance on Optimism to bring restaking yields on top of DeFi opportunities. Will the project be open source?: Yes, our code can be accessed here - https://github.com/Kelp-DAO/ Free or fee-based for end users?: Kelp does not charge fees currently on staking and restaking yields. However, it will be established once we have a DAO in place. Is it composable with other projects on Optimism? How?: Since $wrsETH is an ERC-20 in nature, it can easily be integrated with various DeFi opportunities across Optimism.

**Please briefly answer all market analysis questions**

Competitors and differentiation: Major Competitors are other liquid restaking protocols such as Etherfi and Renzo. Here are a few advantages Kelp has over its competitors- Multi Asset Restaking: Kelp supports liquid restaking of ETH and LSTs such as ETHx, stETH and sfrxETH and ETH on Ethereum and ETH on other Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum, Base, Blast, Linea, Optimism, Scroll and Mode. This offers users flexibility to restake any Eth denominated asset anywhere. Distribution : Kelp being started by Stader Labs’ co-founders, has the advantages of Stader’s existing distribution relationships and DeFi relationships. Stader has 50+ DeFi and distribution partnerships that will be leveraged for Kelp. Examples of Stader’s existing relationships include Aave, Compound, Ledger, MetaMask etc. Minimal Slippage Native restaking across L2s : Through Kelp’s partnership with LayerZero and Stargate, we are able to support native restaking with almost zero slippage. Bridging : Through LayerZero’s infrastructure users are able to bridge rsETH from mainnet and other L2s to Optimism with lowest levels of slippage. Current user base and estimation method : Currently there are about 3.4K users of Kelp on Optimism and over 50K+ on Mainnet and other L2s.

**Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions**

Steps to increase user interaction : Kelp will be working with leading DeFi protocols and Optimism native distribution partners to help increase user interaction with restaking assets Target audience characteristics : The current audience characteristics includes holders of ETH on Optimism and holders of rsETH on mainnet or other L2s. Additionally, any user interested in earning restaking rewards and contributing to the restaking ecosystem is also a part of our target audience. User interaction with Optimism : This will increase the number of restaking users on Optimism while bringing in more transactions and secure passive yield earning for users Competitors on Optimism : Current competitors on Optimism include EtherFi and Renzo

**Select the metric specified in the mission request**

(Intent 3 Growth) TVL in grantee’s protocol

**Fill out your metric objective**

Our metric objective for this grant is the growth of overall TVL (including native restaking + bridging) on Optimism. 

We will be tracking this weekly using onchain metrics and publishing on a public dashboard 

**Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions**

Size of request and justification : We request 120K OP for this phase of the grant. The grant will be used for growing liquid restaking TVL and liquidity with the main focus on increasing market size on Optimism for users interested in restaking rewards. 120K OP will be distributed for building liquidity on DeFi protocols on Optimism. KelpDAO currently hosts more than $900 Mn TVL deposited by 50K+ users on the mainnet and other Layer 2 solutions. We believe that this grant will be successful in increasing the market size for restaked assets on Optimism Plan for accomplishing the project (roadmap): Our roadmap for the grant includes - Expanding minting and bridging of wrsETH on Optimism, incentivising users to create liquidity for restaked assets. We will be keeping milestones based on the following levers- TVL on Optimism DeFi TVL on Optimism Lending Market TVL on Optimism rsETH bridgers and holders on Optimism will continue to receive boosted Kelp miles and Optimism token boosts. Users would be prompted to earn higher boosts if they participate in DeFi on Optimism. KelpDAO will partner with Tier 1 protocols and the affiliated OP social channels to ensure the right media distribution channels to reach maximum ETH holders across Optimism and rsETH holders across Mainnet and other L2s interested in Kelp Miles and OP rewards. Partnering with Tier 1 DeFi protocols to ensure utility and yield earning opportunities for wrsETH holders on Optimism. OP tokens distribution (percentages and initiatives): Summarising the current OP tokens distributions - Native restaking and Bridging incentives - 30% of the grant DeFi opportunities across DeXes, Lending Protocols, Yield Optimisers and Vaults - 70% of the grant (we will be working on this further to provide more details on the breakdown) Token distribution timeline : Token distribution of the timeline would be following the suggested duration of 3 months Sustainability post-incentives : The boosted OP incentives will lay the base for restaking assets on Optimism and allow for organic growth over the long run. We are certain that even after the duration of the grant, users will be interested in contributing to restaking through Optimism based on the restaking rewards and novel infrastructure.

Superchain composability potential Project can't be extended to the Superchain ecosystem Project has multiple challenges to be extended to the Superchain ecosystem Project has the potential to be extended to the Superchain ecosystem Problem solved for Optimism : With the help of the grant, Kelp will be able to grow the restaking market and community further on Optimism. This would increase existing TVL and DeFi liquidity for restaking assets on Optimism with slippage free native restaking and bridging assets. Value proposition : Kelp brings in the value proposition of providing best in class restaking rewards for users on Optimism. This grant helps in making the process more incentivising and sticky in nature. Growth potential for Optimism : The grant and its recipients like us open up Optimism to a $10Bn opportunity of additional TVL from mainnet and other Layers 2s. It truly helps make Optimism the base for LRTs. Commitment to building on Optimism : We have been working on Optimism since April 2024 and are dedicated to contribute further to the ecosystem with our resources. Deployment status (exclusively on Optimism, on Optimism and other networks, not yet deployed, etc.): Kelp’s dapp allows users to natively restake ETH on Optimism, mainnet and other Layer 2 solutions.
