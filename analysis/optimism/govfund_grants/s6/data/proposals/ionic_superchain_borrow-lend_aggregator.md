**Please briefly explain how we will be able to confirm that the OP has been spent:**

It will be listed as emissions on our UI and sent to users in realtime.

Mission Request Application: IONIC A proposal for servicing [Mission Request] Superchain Borrow/Lend Aggregator (https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-superchain-borrow-lend-aggregator/8811) Ionic Protocol Team: ‘A lending aggregator is something that we have been thinking of for a long time at Ionic. The vision of the OP stack interop protocol allows this to become a reality in a way that provides a seamless user experience that has not been possible before. Although a ‘general aggregator’ idea is cool, we think providing the best UX for lending/borrowing specifically is something that would take a bit of specialization from a team that understands Superchain lending very well. We are supportive of this vision and we’re eager to execute on it as a Superchain super app!’ Summary Ionic is going mutli-rollup on the superchain with a V2 on 8 new rollups including OP mainnet, Mode, Base, Fractal, BOB, Soneium, Lisk, Metal L2, and Ozean, seeking to become the defacto interoperability money market for the OP Stack servicing all Superchain rollups present and future. Ionic is priming to be the defacto borrow/lend protocol for the Superchain, so this MR makes perfect sense for our project. With deployments on all networks, a unique focus on OP stack Interoperability, +200M in TVL, over 100k users and partnerships with most liquidity providers and assets across the superchain, Ionic is uniquely positioned to execute on this Mission Request and bring a cutting edge aggregator to market. With the experience in interoperability from Ionic’s Leadership team (coming from Everclear/Connext (bridge) and LiFi/Jumper (cross chain dex aggregator)), the team understands the challenges and inner workings of a cross chain aggregator in depth. Ionic is currently researching ways in which we can add the most value to the OP Superchain and a lending aggregator with advanced yield farming integrations can be a great way to contribute to the liquidity environment across the ecosystem while enabling a more abstract way for DeFi users to engage in complex strategies. We have drafted the necessary technical documentation (confidential) for this endeavor and are confident we can execute on it efficiently with the right resources and support at our disposal. Execution ‘Think Jumper but for Lending’ We have identified a number of technical improvements to build an industry leading aggregator for the OP Superchain: Onchain AI agent-controlled vault infrastructure to seek yield. OP Superchain native interop to identify opportunities and dynamically rebalance positions. Automated looping of borrows and position management. The agents will work to provide the user a hands-off yield generation experience by sourcing yield from multiple protocols and abstracting the experience to the end user. Approach To execute on this mission request we would like to propose a sequenced dev>testing>iteration>production loop, scheduled spanning from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025. For this request we are seeking to hire two more protocol engineers to focus exclusively on developing a custom solution for the aggregator and its user interface/ux. Further we are seeking a ‘joint superchain strategy’ with OP core and OP interoperability, in which we will be working closely with the Superchain core dev team to use the OP stack solution exclusively for cross chain messaging and low level infra. Finally we would like to propose a joint bd strategy to enable fast growth both on integration side, as well as user side to ensure expected volumes are met as soon as a production ready app has been shipped. Open Source? This project will be open sourced and free to end users (minus interest rates). Questions Open questions: The Mission Request allocation of 30,000OP is extremely low for development of an advanced solution, to cover costs for engineering, UI development, auditing, marketing expenses, as well as user incentives for bootstrapping usage of the app once it’s in production. We are seeking liquid funds to help bootstrap volume through the aggregator, and would appreciate support and intros for this purpose specifically. We would like to request approval to incentivize the use of the aggregator with $ION tokens.

**Please briefly answer all market analysis questions**

Competitors and differentiation: Multiple Money Markets across the Superchain, including MoonWell, Morpho, Aave, and others. We are different due to our Multichain approach form the get go, aligning exclusively with OP Stack interop to develop a truly native OP Superchain Protocol 2. Current user base and estimation method: Current user base is 114k defi power users, we seek to 10x this with an advanced AI powered aggregator terminal.

**Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions**

Steps to increase user interaction: Simplified UX, similar to Jumper, 'terminal'-like UI completely abstracts the mutlichain infrastructure. Target audience characteristics: DeFi power users across the entire Superchain User interaction with Optimism: Liquidity provision, asset utilization, cross chain transactions. Competitors on Optimism: All Money Markets, most yield apps.

**Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions**

Size of request and justification: 30000 OP as per mission request, to cover costs for engineering, UI development, auditing, marketing expenses, as well as user incentives for bootstrapping usage of the app once it’s in production. Plan for accomplishing the project (roadmap): Develop Smart contract infrastructure in tune with OP stack interoperability team/progress. Refine UI to match. OP tokens distribution (percentages and initiatives): 90% for Operations, 10% for User incetives. Token distribution timeline: Q4 2024, Q1 2025. Sustainability post-incentives: $ION emissions + user engagement via liquidty campaigns similar to Superfest. Additional accountability info (smart contract addresses, wallet addresses, etc.): Can be provided.

**Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions**

Problem solved for Optimism Resolves Money Market liquidtiy fragmentation across all chains and apps. Improves multichain liquidity environment. Improved DeFi usability for users with abstracted UI, makes it easier for users to identify best yield opportunities across the Superchain. Overall better capital efficiency. Value proposition Improved capital efficiency and resource optimization across all chains and apps + simplified DeFi usability for end users. Growth potential for Optimism Acting as a 'Lending Liquidity Highway' for the Superchain will create more velocity in the Superchain DeFi ecosystem, ultimately resulting in a more vibrant and efficient Ecosystem. Commitment to building on Optimism: 100% commited to building on any and all L2s on the OP Stack, and only the Superchain. Deployment status (exclusively on Optimism, on Optimism and other networks, not yet deployed, etc.): On OP, Mode, Base, Lisk, Bob, Fraxtal + soon on Ozean, Metal L2, Soneium and more.
