Polynomial Chain 

**Name of the Chain:**

Polynomial Chain 

**Description of the existing grants program, if applicable.**

Our team received a 'Phase 0' grant from the governance fund ( https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-polynomial-protocol/1625 ) where we had included a grants program for contributors, bug bounties, tooling, hackathons and more. We have distributed 50+ grants rewarding all types of projects and builders that helped us in growing Polynomial and Optimism. To name a few: Sponsored an Ethereum Hackathon hosted by Devfolio. Dune Dashboards created for all perps across the ecosystem. Content Creation to educate non native crypto users and beginner traders. Code Audits by Security Researchers. Integrations with DeFiLlama, Zapper and more by community members. AI Discord bot for answering queries from the docs. Integrations like Zapper, DeFiLlama etc. All the grants given out can be tracked here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16ROnQl8JNeVqmMqYef2_F6te4QF_tqmK_RBkCL9UNDA/ Drawing from the insights and experiences gained from running this initiative for the last 2 years, we have developed our current plan. We are committed to following a structure similar to Optimisms', particularly regarding retroactive public goods funding. Although our chain has just launched, we are already planning to sponsor and host hackathons and support projects through various means like quadratic voting, have security competitions and much more that aim to leverage Polynomial's liquidity and expand across the Superchain. While the grants program for chain is still being finalized internally, we welcome feedback from Superchain Reviewers and the community to help refine it.

**Defined Process:**

Grant Program Process: Our grant program is designed to support innovative projects and initiatives within the Polynomial ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of how the process will work: Submitting Applications: Grant applications can be submitted via a platform that will be announced soon. (TBD but ideally we want to use an onchain tool here like attest.org , devfolio.co or questbook.app ). The platform will be easy to use, and accessible for everyone to ensure distribution. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis and processed as they come in. Grant Committee: Our grant committee will consist of senior members from Polynomial, including developers, Developer Relations (DevRels), and the Business Development (BD) team. Review Process: Applications will go through two stages of review to ensure we support the best projects. 1. Initial Screening Phase: Applications will be initially screened for: Completeness Adherence to basic eligibility criteria. 2. Evaluation Phase: Grants are reviewed by a minimum of 3 team members on a standard rubric. Grants are evaluated based on their alignment with Polynomial's and Optimism's strategic priorities, including a focus on Derivatives and DeFi. Grants are judged based on their potential to garner users, transactions, mindshare, branding, improvment in security or to drive liquidity. If grants meet a threshold score (TBD) they will pass the review stage and move on to distribution of funds and setting of milestones. This is typically completed within four to six weeks of submission. If the grant requires more time, the program is divided into a minimum of 2 phases with critical and benchmark milestones In all cases, the projects are expected to submit a breakdown of cost as well as a timeline expectation during which they will be using the grant funds. Incentives and Milestones: To encourage progress, we’ll set milestones for grantees. This ensures teams stay motivated and on track, with incentives tied to achieving these goals. Future Plans: We envision multiple ways to run this program and will finalize the exact details with input from Optimism Reviewers, our Community and Stakeholders. By combining expert review with community involvement, we aim to create a dynamic and supportive environment for groundbreaking projects in the Polynomial and OP Superchain ecosystem. We are passionate about supporting public goods and leveraging community input. Going forward as the program progresses, we'll use community voting, including quadratic voting, to help decide which projects receive funding.

**Defined Decision Makers**

Our grant approval process is designed to ensure the best projects get the support they need. Every decision requires a unanimous vote from 1-4 people, depending on the project type and grant size. Gautham : Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer. Gautham's visionary leadership ensures the grantees get all the product guidance that they need to stay ahead of the curve. Salman : Co-Founder, Optimism Grants Delegate. Salman's expertise in building partnerships and driving growth would be of great importance to the grant projects. Mubaris : Co-Founder and CTO. Mubaris leads our technical innovation, so is the best person in panel with respect to smart contracts and security implementation of the grant. Shlok : Chief of Staff & Developer Relations. With his previous experience leading the ETHIndia Grants program, he brings invaluable insights and a deep understanding of the developer community to this grants council.

**Defined Mandate:**

At Polynomial, our grant program aims to build deep liquidity and attract more Total Value Locked (TVL) to our and overall Superchain ecosystem. Bootstrap Liquidity and Boost DeFi Adoption We’re looking for projects that align with Polynomial's and the Superchain's vision, particularly those utilizing our liquidity layer. We’ll kick off with initial liquidity incentives for DEXes on Polynomial, launching liquidity mining programs on the most active DEXes. Metrics : TVL on deployed protocols. Drive Ecosystem Engagement and Growth Support initiatives that increase on-chain user engagement and daily activity, while also driving transaction volume and gas fee usage. Metrics : DAU, growth rate, transaction volume, and gas fees paid. Amplify Security and Infrastructure Development Prioritize projects that enhance the security and infrastructure of the Polynomial and Superchain ecosystems, including oracles, bridges, and onramp solutions. Metrics : Security audits conducted, improvements in protocol resilience, and active developer addresses interacting with grantee contracts. Incentivize Multichain Efforts Offer incentives for multichain protocols to deploy on Polynomial and for liquidity mining initiatives that attract and retain users. Metrics : Number of multichain protocols onboarded, TVL from liquidity mining, and market share of TVL. Expand Marketing and Mindshare Increase awareness and build strong mindshare for projects within the Polynomial ecosystem, driving community engagement and brand recognition. Metrics : Community engagement, social media reach, and overall brand presence in the Superchain ecosystem.

**Intent #3B Alignment:**

Polynomial is rapidly becoming a key player in the Superchain, particularly in the derivatives space, as our Total Value Locked (TVL) and trading volume continue to grow. Our grants program is designed to boost liquidity and spur development across the Superchain, positioning our derivatives superchain as the go-to liquidity layer for all derivatives, while also serving as a launchpad for projects expanding within the Superchain. Key Initiatives: Unified Liquidity Layer : We’re establishing Polynomial as the main liquidity provider for derivatives within the Superchain, ensuring smooth integration and robust liquidity support for all projects. Developer Incentives : We’re offering incentives to developers and contributors to build and expand within the Polynomial ecosystem, driving innovation that benefits not just us but the entire Superchain community. Derivatives Ecosystem Enhancement : We’re backing the development and integration of various DeFi protocols, especially those focused on perpetual derivatives, with a strong emphasis on projects that enhance the entire Superchain ecosystem. Increased Revenue : As Polynomial grows, Optimism benefits as well, thanks to our Revenue Share agreement, contributing to the broader success of the Superchain.

**OP Chain Contribution:**

Important Note : As part of our commitment to the Law of Chains, we allocate 15% of our sequencer revenue to the Optimism Collective. Currently, we do not have any other revenue-sharing agreements with Optimism, whether with the Foundation or Governance. Based on our current data, Polynomial is in the early stages of our superchain launch and thus has a relatively modest contribution to the OP ecosystem compared to established L2s like Base, OP Mainnet and Mode. Even though we have recently launched on the Superchain, we've been key contributors to OP since 2022, being among the first few dApps on OP Mainnet. Over the past 3 years, we’ve built 2 protocols in the derivative asset management and perpetual DEXs space which has helped redefine DeFi on Optimism since the early days. Our first protocol, Polynomial Earn, an options vault designed to provide users with yield exposure from options selling, showed that such a sophisticated & entirely onchain app could be built by partnering with Lyra (another early OP Mainnet dApp). With Earn, we had over 63K users and generated more than $150M in notional volume within a span of one year. Polynomial Trade has driven $4.7+ billion in trading volume on OP Mainnet since its launch in March 2023. When we started, Optimism’s derivative volume share was just 0.25%. Six months later, we became the largest perpetual DEX on the platform, helping to boost Optimism’s derivative share to 25% by August, 2024. Source: link . We're proven stewards of grants and have always been at the forefront of innovation and generosity. For example, we’ve provided grants to core developers at other OP derivative projects, showcasing our commitment to the OP community. Source: link . Show the side of governance and collective work we’ve done We’ve earned the trust of the Optimism Collective multiple times, recognized at the Eagle Tier due to grants in Phase 0 (as of one of the first dApps in Optimism Mainnet) and in RetroFunding 5 . Additionally, our team has developed valuable tools like the Optimistic Indexer (helps early-stage projects quickly and freely index events) and Bytes (educational content to onboard new users to the crypto space and the Superchain), which received OPRPGF4 support. These acknowledgments highlight our commitment to driving innovation and growth within the ecosystem. We’ve been entrusted by the Optimism Collective to advance its vision in several other impactful ways as well. As a top 100 delegate on Optimism, we actively participate in governance with frequent voting. Additionally, we've been part of the Protocol Delegation Program for both seasons. Demonstrating our commitment to contributing and driving progress within the ecosystem.

**Grants Allocation Framework:**

We intend to run an open-ended competitive grants program with public applications. These applications will then undergo the two-step evaluation process of ' Initial Screening' and ' Evaluation Phase' explained above. The program will be a blend of open-ended competitive grants for all projects, invite-only grants for strategic initiatives aligned with our ecosystem’s goals, and targeted support for pre-identified projects that we want to collaborate with. Grant Sizes: Most projects are expected to receive grants ranging from 2,000 to 50,000 OP. Exceptional initiatives and established protocols may qualify for grants up to 100,000 OP. Approval Philosophy: The focus is on awarding "smaller" grants quickly to support teams that demonstrate the ability to grow and manage funds effectively. "Smaller" grants also help us is casting a wider net and onboarding exceptional people to the Superchain early on. This approach also ensures an environment where we are continuously backing promising projects as they progress and achieve milestones Grant Allocation Categories and Distribution: Initial Bootstrapping (35%): Provide liquidity incentives for DEXes on Polynomial to kickstart market depth and engagement. This includes launching liquidity mining programs on the most active platforms to ensure robust initial liquidity. Protocol Activity (30%): Drive trading activity and institutional participation by supporting projects that boost transaction volume and active use of the Polynomial liquidity layer. Encourage the deployment of innovative trading strategies and lending protocols. Technical Integrations (15%): Support the integration of third-party technologies, such as oracles and bridges, that facilitate seamless interaction within the Polynomial ecosystem and the broader Superchain. Infrastructure Development (10%): Fund projects focused on building essential infrastructure, including Indexers, Explorers, RPCs and price feeds, that enhance the overall functionality and user experience within the ecosystem. Security (10%): Invest in regular audits and security enhancements to ensure the integrity and safety of the Polynomial and Superchain networks. This helps maintain trust and protect users from vulnerabilities.

**Target Metrics:**

We will follow the metrics used by Grants Council, with greater emphasis on growth metrics. Growth: TVL in the grantee’s protocol Number of transactions emitting event logs Number of active addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts The total amount of gas fees generated from grantee’s contracts Stickiness: Percentage of retained active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts DAA/MAA ratio Developer Tooling: Number of testnet transactions emitting event logs Number of active developer addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts

**Milestones:**

Is the chain currently live or scheduled to go live during Season 6? (Live: contributing revenue to the collective) Milestones for grant recipients will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Recipients will be required to meet predefined milestones. Release of funds will be based on their ability to demonstrate progress in these areas. The Metrics might defer for every grant based on what the grant is for but the milestones will be helping us in achieving the key metrics either directly or indirectly. The Key Metrics for most grants would be focusing on Total Value Locked (TVL) and the Number of Depositors to the Chain (active addresses). These metrics will help us gauge the growth and impact of the projects.

**Impact Analysis:**

Polynomial will create dashboards to track progress metrics and produce a comprehensive formal report at the end of the program to the Grants Council. 

Key Progress Metrics include Number of New Projects on Polynomial Chain, User Growth, Total Value Locked (TVL), Transaction Volume, Contracts deployed on Polynomial, Sequencer Profit, ETH Contributed to the Optimism Collective, Grants distributed and New users on Polynomial Chain.
 
The formal report will cover successes, areas for improvement, program structure evaluation, and a before-and-after analysis of all target metrics. 

**Token Delivery:**

Polynomial will use a multisig to distribute grants to successful applicants after KYC.

User incentive grants will be distributed after KYC completion. 

Grants will be distributed based on milestone completion to ensure teams stay motivated and on track, with incentives tied to achieving the goals. 

**Sustainability:**

The insights gained from this program will be crucial for any future grants programs.

We will offer guidance and support to all grantees through our internal resources and external stakeholders to help develop a viable business model. 

**External Contributions:**

Gonna ( https://x.com/GonnaEth) from Optimism Grants DAO is helping Polynomial team with any questions we might have regarding the planning and application.

We'll be looking for direct feedback on our grants program from members of the Optimism Grants Council.
