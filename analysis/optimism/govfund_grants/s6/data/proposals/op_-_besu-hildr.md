# OP - Besu/Hildr

**Project URL:** [Link](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/op-besu-hildr-729952251744669)

**Audit Service Provider:**

Spearbit/Cantina

**Project name:**

OP-Besu/Hildr 

**What is this project about?**

The projects are OP Stack Rollup node and execution client written in Java follow OP Stack specs. They could be used by the OP Stack chain operator to run as an OP Stack validator.

**Distribution plan:**

All liquid OP will be used to payout bugs/issues for the OP - Besu & Hildr Cantina competition. OP tokens will be used towards the total prize pool and used for any admin/support costs in running the competition like paying for a judge to review and evaluate the results.

**What is this project going to build?**

Why is what they are going to build novel or valuable to Optimism? The most important value is to bring client diversity to optimism and help it achieve its decentralization intention. At present, Ethereum already has clients implemented in several programming languages, and there is already a Java-based client, which occupies a certain proportion of deployment. While there is currently no Java-based client on the OP stack, we are the first team to provide a Java version of op-node, which seems like a cool thing. How is this project likely to bring and keep new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? The Java ecosystem is a large community, the Java client could attract many Java developers. Teku/Besu(Java) ranks third in the proportion of Ethereum client running nodes. Hildr/op-besu can make it easy for these users to run OP Stack nodes, making it easy for these users to enter the OP Stack ecosystem. What are some comparable projects? What differentiates this one? For Hildr(Java), magi(Rust) and op-node(Go) are comparable projects, but because they all use different languages, they are complementary. For op-besu(Java), op-reth(Rust), op-erigon(Go), op-geth(Go) and op-nethermind(.Net) are comparable projects, also because they all use different languages, they are complementary. Will this project be fee-based or free to the end user?
Free.
Will this project pay for any portion of the service?
No.
Will this project be open-source?
Yes.

**Is this project funded?**

Hildr got OP Cycle 13 grant and RetroPGF 3 Op-besu got OP season 5  OP Cycle 22 grant

**Has this project been the subject of a security breach?**

No

**Do you anticipate any particular issues or complexity in providing services to this project?**

No. Context of Scope: code changes op-besu: https://optimism-java.github.io/op-besu/ (op java https://github.com/optimism-java/op-besu) : +3729 sloc code changes https://github.com/optimism-java/hildr/tree/main/hildr-utilities : 6,231 sloc https://github.com/optimism-java/hildr/tree/main/hildr-node : 10,286 sloc

**Please provide details from your due diligence on this project and audit scope (the due diligence must contain the complexity of the scope, test coverage, and test methodologies applied to the scope)**

Given the nature of the codebase, in terms of nloc, complexity of code and skills required the best solution would be to leverage a Cantina security competition. We can look to utilise our network of 1000+ security researchers to participate in the engagement. This project will be fully open source and a Cantina competition will align with open source ethos of this project - we will also look to invite security researchers on our end with the valid expertise and skill set needed for this scope. Context of Audit Scope: code changes op-besu: https://optimism-java.github.io/op-besu/ (op java https://github.com/optimism-java/op-besu ) : +3729 sloc code changes https://github.com/optimism-java/hildr/tree/main/hildr-utilities : 6,231 sloc https://github.com/optimism-java/hildr/tree/main/hildr-node : 10,286 sloc We would recommend a competition rewards pot of 94,191 - OP tokens and 43,171 OP tokens for administration, facilitation and judging of the competition. This codebase is large with of medium complexity making Cantina competitions a great fit here for security coverage. Upon review given complexity, assessment of team, plus the service/strategy recommended Cantina competitions. We do not anticipate needing any extensions, but if we encounter anything that would indicate the need for extensions we will inform the client immediately. A fix review period at the end of the competition will be handled and picked from the top peformers of the competition and this review period will be scoped based exactly on the fixes/remediations created, so no extension would be needed for that.

**Optimism alignment**

Hildr/op-besu are fully aligned with OP Stack’s technical decentralization intent and can only be used in the OP Stack ecosystem.

**What does this audit unlock for the project?**

Because the two projects are not from well-known companies in the industry, the audit reports from industry-leading security companies can enhance the popularity and trust of the projects, allowing users to have greater confidence and willingness to try and use them.
