**Defined Process:**

The existing Cyber Ecosystem Grants Program runs on a quarterly basis. Round I closed in May, Round 2 is closed in August and Round 3 is expected to begin in September. The process described below is for the existing Cyber Ecosystem Grants Program, the process for new programs created to distribute OP grants may not follow this exact structure, but they will follow a similar process across key phases: submission, thorough evaluation, selection, and ongoing support. Processes will evolve based on the learnings from the Cyber Ecosystem Grants Program and other grant initiatives. Any changes will be based off of data and learnings from the execution of grant programs. Application Submission: Application window is open for ~3 weeks, during which applicants submit proposals detailing: project information, milestones, and funding requirements. Initial Review: The Cyber Grants Council , which consists of community-nominated experts in web3, investors, and creators, conducts an initial review to assess alignment with Cyber’s goals, project feasibility, and potential impact. Evaluation and Discussion: The Cyber Grants Council discusses each application in detail. This phase also lasts ~3 weeks. During which, the council may request additional information. The focus is on confirming the milestones, ensuring that the proposed projects are aligned with Cyber’s mission, and evaluating the project's potential for success. Milestone Confirmation: The council works with the applicants to define clear and achievable milestones. Selection and Announcement: After evaluation, the council finalizes the list of the selected projects. Projects must complete a KYC process and funding is allocated based on the project's stage and category. Payment is made upon meeting the mutually agreed milestones. (E.g., Deployment on Cyber Mainnet, Meet certain transaction numbers, TVL targets, etc.) Post-Approval Support: Additional Support: Grantees receive not only funding but also mentorship, networking opportunities, co-marketing support, and other resources to help them succeed.

**Defined Mandate:**

To accelerate the growth of the Cyber ecosystem and deployment of social applications within the Superchain. 1. Attract Builders To Cyber Through Rewards & Incentives Before the launch of Cyber, we released several solutions that have been used to build social applications (e.g., CyberConnect Social Graph Protocol , Cyber AA Wallet , and CyberID ). From this, we know many projects are actively building in the space. Now that Cyber is live on Mainnet, we’re eager to bring these teams onto the first chain built specifically for them. Onchain social has huge potential, but many use cases are still in the experimentation phase so most projects are working to find their product-market fit (PMF). If we can help a few projects achieve their PMF, we believe they will serve as examples and inspiration for other builders, ultimately driving significant growth in the Superchain ecosystem and the social space as a whole. Today, we have a handful of applications on Cyber that users can interact with. We've generated significant activity through marketing campaigns like the Superchain wide Social Summer , which have successfully increased brand awareness. Our goal is to support projects that Cyber users find engaging and can sustain activity beyond specific campaigns. Goals: Support projects building new social applications to launch on Cyber. Incentivize the development of applications for new use cases within onchain social, raising its profile and aiding other builders. Support projects that can attract new users as well as provide existing users new ways to participate in the Cyber ecosystem and across the Superchain. Expand Cyber’s user base and increase user engagement for new and existing users. Metrics: new projects deployed on Cyber, # of apps built natively using existing protocols and infra (CyberConnect, etc.), transactions per project, and user metrics - new user growth, user retention, user interaction frequency. 2. Onboard Leading Multichain Protocols and Assets Now that Cyber is live on Mainnet and we've build some brand reputation, we’re ready to attract established multichain protocols, like Farcaster, within the social space to deploy on Cyber and support our growing ecosystem. Leveraging these protocols will create network effects and enhance the user experience as users explore what Cyber has to offer. By bringing established protocols onboard, we aim to boost Cyber’s presence in the multichain landscape and enrich the social applications built on Cyber. Goals: Provide incentives for established multichain protocols within the social space to deploy on Cyber and support applications on Cyber. Leverage these protocols to create network effects and improve the UX on Cyber. Expand Cyber’s and the Superchain’s market share in total transactions and TVL within these multichain protocols. Metrics: # of new established multichain protocols, Cyber’s market-share of total Txs & TVL on multichain protocols. 3. Invest in Infrastructure and Developer Tooling That Drive Collective Growth As we expand the Cyber ecosystem, we want to continue invest in infrastructure and developer tooling that simplify the deployment of the applications mentioned above (the ones that we had a great experience working with include: Privy , Pimlico , Quicknode , and many more). Our goal is to support the projects who are building solutions that not only benefit individual developers but also facilitate their integration with other applications. This will enhance the broader Superchain ecosystem by fostering complementary growth across projects. By supporting innovation in developer resources, we want to accelerate innovation and attract more talented builders to both Cyber and the Superchain. Goals: Provide incentives for established multichain protocols within the social space to deploy on Cyber and support applications on Cyber. Leverage these protocols to create network effects and improve the UX on Cyber. Expand Cyber’s and the Superchain’s market share in total transactions and TVL within these multichain protocols. Metrics: # of projects integrated, # of active developer addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts & overall growth in developer activity. 4. Sponsor Events in the Cyber Ecosystem Since launching Cyber to mainnet, we have organized a few events (e.g. Superchain Social Summer Party ) to boost brand awareness and engage partners within the space. Most of these self-hosted events have been social in nature, focused on promoting the Cyber and Superchain narratives. Moving forward, we aim to sponsor a more diverse range of events, including builder meetups, hackathons, and events that cement Cyber as the Layer 2 for social applications. As part of this, we would like to incentivize community members to host their own Cyber-related events and hackathons. This approach would enable engaged Cyber contributors and communities to tailor events to specific audiences—whether regional markets or particular types of users and builders. By sponsoring these events, we intend to onboard new kinds of users and audiences to both the Superchain and Cyber. Goals: Provide incentives for community members and contributors to host events for Cyber and the Superchain. Diversify the types of events within the Cyber ecosystem. Expand Cyber’s and the Superchain’s presence at leading crypto events with large developer and user bases. Metrics: # of events hosted, attendance #s, # of new projects from developer events. 5. Integrate with Major Wallet Partners like OKX Wallet / Coinbase Wallet / Rainbow Wallet / Zerion At Cyber, our current priority is to attract more developers to build the next generation social apps. However, new apps, especially social ones, require a significant user bases to trigger network effects. Partnering with leading wallets is an excellent distribution channel to access millions of new users and enhance the experience for existing users. When integrating with wallet partners, we’d like to deploy rewards to incentive new users to participate in campaigns. This summer, we launched the Superchain-wide Social Summer, aiming to increase awareness of the Superchain, reward projects and artists contributing to the ecosystem, and bootstrap the Cyber network. We teamed up with Binance Web3 Wallet to distribute $510k, encouraging users to have fun and explore the Superchain ecosystem—and the results were outstanding. With Binance Web3 Wallet’s integration with Cyber Mainnet, we saw over 150k new users join Social Summer and mint NFTs on Cyber Mainnet. Of the new users who bridged onto Cyber Given the success of our collaboration with Binance Web3 Wallet, we recognize that integrating with major wallets like Coinbase Wallet and OKX Wallet would make it easier to onboard to Cyber, further enhance the UX, and for continuing to grow both the Cyber and Superchain ecosystems. Funds received for integrating with major wallet partners would be deployed to users and part of a campaign, rather than used to pay for an infrastructure integration. Goals: Integrate leading wallet providers with Cyber Mainnet. Onboard users through incentivized campaigns. Metrics: Number of wallets integrated, number of new users coming to Cyber via wallet providers, number of transactions these users made on Cyber Mainnet, and user retention rate.

**Intent #3B Alignment:**

Our vision is to establish Cyber as the Superchain’s home for social applications, similar to Mode’s role in DeFi. During the past several months, we have been focused on positioning Cyber as the Superchain’s social hub and a key entry point for developers building innovative social apps, as well as users passionate about onchain social. Through our Superchain Social Summer Campaign , we've raised awareness about Cyber's mission among 140K+ users with over 2M+ NFT mints . We want our grants program to build on this momentum, providing incentives for founders and developers to actively contribute to the Cyber ecosystem. Our goal is to incubate applications and establish Cyber as a chain for experimentation for applications with social features. As the Superchain’s member chains become interoperable, we envision that features developed on Cyber will be embedded into applications across other OP chains, adding value to the broader ecosystem that exceeds the sum of its parts. The social features and applications developed on Cyber will become integrable with other applications on OP chains, enabling different types of apps on various OP chains to become more engaging through social features built on Cyber. For our next phase, we are looking to onboard more developers building web3 social applications. Cyber has been chosen as the home base by several social applications already, and we are actively expanding our ecosystem for many ways. We are in talks with many existing projects building at the frontier of Web3 social. We are in close conversation with dscvr.one , one of the largest social apps on Solana with 70K DAU , and UXLink , the largest social platform on Arbitrum , to bring them and similar projects, onto Cyber and the Superchain. As the only chain for social in the Superchain ecosystem and the L2 landscape, we would love to have Optimism Governance’s support in our mission to become the home base for web3 social applications.

**OP Chain Contribution:**

Despite being a young chain (publicly announce mainnet in May), we’re actively contributing to the Superchain: most notably, in network activity and raising awareness of the Superchain. Activity Since launch, Cyber has processed 18M+ transactions. According to the Superchain Health Dashboard, in the month of August, Cyber is already contributing the most monthly TXNs to the Superchain (as of August 8/23, and excluding Base and OP Mainnet). Most of these transactions are the result of our 6-week Superchain Social Summer campaign, where we showcased chains, ecosystems, and projects across the Superchain. Additionally, projects that were recipients of our Pilot Grants Program round have already deployed on Cyber and contributed 5M+ transactions ( XO and Bitmon ). These are Cyber native and are contributing transactions daily. As more projects are incubated and deployed on Cyber through the grants program, we expect to see Cyber’s contribution to the Superchain in terms of transactions to only increase (as well as the associated fees). A dashboard analyzing the Cyber Gas Bridge , created by a community member, shows that around two-thirds of the unique users (77k+ total) who have bridged onto Cyber have come from Arbitrum. This indicates a significant number of net new users to the Superchain, demonstrating our effectiveness in increasing awareness and driving transactions within the ecosystem with our Social Summer campaign (more below). Superchain Awareness As part of our Superchain-wide Social Summer , we're currently deploying over $500k in CYBER rewards to attract and educate new users about the Superchain. This 6-week campaign features multiple Superchain ecosystems and 36 projects, with specially designed NFTs from artists like SecretPikachu, SOJU, and TEJI. We also partnered with Binance Web3 Wallet to offer $510k in rewards to their users who join the campaign and explore amazing communities building across the Superchain ecosystem. We have also distributed an additional 6k CYBER ($20k+) to creators, who made their own Superchain themed content which has generated over 2M impressions on X and Warpcast. Originally a small Cyber campaign, Social Summer expanded into a Superchain-wide initiative under the Onchain Summer umbrella. We've actively promoted cross-Superchain collaboration, including initiatives like a BasePaint Social Summer featured canvas and a live stream on Unlonely on Base. Our campaign has highlighted projects who are creating amazing communities across the Superchain, whether they’re building on Base , Zora , Optimism , Cyber, Farcaster , and beyond. Here’s a video where our Head of BD, Ricky, on the Good News Onchain show with Binji from the OP team to talk about how the idea of the Superchain Social Summer became a reality. The campaign also included a revenue share (a total of $100K) with all 36 projects featured during Social Summer, reinforcing the idea that meaningful community building on the Superchain is rewarded regardless of the chain. Some projects chose not to receive the revenue share due to legal reasons, so we donated it to artist communities active in the Superchain ecosystem. A great example is the revenue share of Zora’s featured NFT, where we donated the funds to Bosque Gracias , an artist group based in São Paulo that contributes significantly to the Zora ecosystem.

**Target Metrics:**

Growth (we agree to use the metrics provided) : Number of transactions emitting event logs Number of active addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts The total amount of gas fees generated from grantee’s contracts Stickiness (we agree to use the metrics provided): Percentage of retained active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts DAA/MAA ratio Developer Tooling (we agree to use the metrics provided): Number of testnet transactions emitting event logs Number of mainnet transactions emitting event logs (we added this ourselves) Number of active developer addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts Community Events: (we added this ourselves) Number of people signed up for the event Number of people participated in the event Number of impressions the event is able to generate on X and Farcaster

**Milestones:**

1(Note: These milestones assume deployment of the maximum amounts described above: 50K OP for Cyber Qualified Social Dapp Grant, 50K OP for Cyber Social Buildathon, 75K OP for Cyber X Farcaster Frame Builder Grant, 25K OP for event organizers in the Cyber ecosystem, and 62.5K OP for Cyber Wallet Partners. If grants are allocated in smaller amounts, we may have more total grantees. However, for application purposes, we are focusing on the upper limit) We expect to award approximately 5 grants to teams invited to build on Cyber, 30 grants to Buildathon developers, 50 grants to Farcaster-Cyber native frame builders, 10 grants to event organizers, and 1 grants to wallet partners. For the Cyber Qualified Social Dapp Grant, we aim for 100% of projects to continue development and collaborate closely with the Cyber team over the next two years. For Cyber Social Buildathon participants, we anticipate >35% will launch beta versions within 4 months and public versions within 10 months after receiving the grant. For Cyber x Farcaster Frame builders, we expect >50% to release beta versions within 2 months and public versions within 5 months after receiving the grant. For event organizers, we expect 5 events to be organized within 3 months of receiving their grant. For wallet partners, we expect at least one campaign focused on incentivizing end users to be launched with leading wallet partners like Coinbase Wallet, OKX Wallet, Rainbow, or Zerion. We are happy to work with the Grants Council to refine our milestones or answer any questions. We will provide a closeout report after completing our grant disbursements, followed by a subsequent impact assessment. This will help both Cyber and Optimism gather valuable data on the effectiveness of our grants programs, informing future adjustments and ensuring ongoing alignment with our goals.

**Impact Analysis:**

We will establish comprehensive tracking panels to monitor key metrics, aligning with our Mandate and Allocation Framework. These will be made open-source for transparency. To ensure effectiveness, we will provide ongoing support to grant recipients, including engineering retrospectives, GTM assistance, and investor intros. 

At the program's conclusion, we will produce a detailed report evaluating successes, areas for improvement, and metric comparisons. A retrospective session will be held to discuss the program’s impact and refine future strategies for Cyber's ecosystem growth. 

**Token Delivery:**

We will use a multisig to distribute grants to successful applicants after KYC.

User incentive grants will be distributed at the time of KYC completion, and locked grants will be distributed 1 year after successful application if milestones are completed. 

**Sustainability:**

Having completed one round of Cyber Ecosystem Grants, we have already incorporated learnings from the pilot round into our grants program. For example, for Round II, applicants were told encouraged to describe their milestones in the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) format to ensure clarity and accountability. This was based on the learning from the first round, where applicants milestone format varied significantly, which made them less comparable. 

The establishment of metrics and milestones in the evaluation process for Cyber ecosystem projects reflects our commitment to fostering long-term, sustainable initiatives within the Cyber ecosystem. As has already been done, the lessons learned during every round of the existing program and new programs will be incorporated into any future grants programs. 

We have several processes in place to ensure that grant recipients can sustain themselves beyond the initial grants. First of all, this is one of the areas projects are assessed on during the evaluation process. Additionally, after being selected, projects receive ongoing support and are eligible for follow-on grants after successfully completing the program if they meet their milestones. For example, XO, a dating app built on Cyber and popular in Taiwan and Asia, was a grantee in the pilot round and was also selected for a second round of grants. This allowed them to expand their scope and set new milestones after their initial success.

We also offer ongoing support in various ways. Beyond funding, we provide mentorship, make introductions to investors and partners, and co-market projects to maximize their chances of success. XO is also a great example for this, as we are assisting their team with their Series A fundraising. In general, we have a strong network of investors and partners and always aim to connect Cyber-based projects with funding when needed.

In terms of the sustainability of the grants program overall, we have plans to apply for follow-on grants and are working to identify additional revenue streams that can be allocated toward sustaining our existing and future grant programs. One potential approach is using a portion of fees generated from specific campaigns to maintain the grants programs—for example, dedicating 20% of revenue generated from specific campaigns like next year's Social Summer. This is merely an illustrative example, as the best revenue stream is still being evaluated.
