If the OP is not in the grant multisig recipient address, then it is in the process of being distributed. It is either in intermediate contracts in the process of being distributed (see later answer about which contracts grant OP will be held or pass through) or has already been transferred to end-user wallets as incentives.

Let's Get HAI is a CDP-backed stablecoin built on Optimism with plans to expand across the superchain. HAI aims to become the go-to decentralized stable for the Superchain, and attract LST and other yield-bearing collaterals to the Superchain. In only 4 months of operation, Let’s Get HAI has become the largest CDP protocol on Optimism, with ~50% of the total CDP TVL on OP in HAI Vaults. This was accomplished with only the time, effort, and capital investment from the DAO's core contributors. Over the long term, we also hope HAI becomes a solution for protocols to better manage grant funds by letting them take an over-collateralized loan against their grant instead of selling it. Perhaps one day, treasury management, including grant management, can benefit from one of the first DeFi primitives: decentralized over-collateralized loans. We believe there is vast white space for adding useful collateral types for users. In addition to being, in our opinion, the best place to borrow against OP tokens (instead of selling them!), we are laser-focused on providing users with other novel choices, including our new integration with Dinero’s (formerly Redacted Cartel) LST, apxETH, and core developers are currently investigating ways to collateralize Velodrome LP positions, which for many users could be a very attractive offering. While current market demand for decentralized stables isn't close to that for centralized ones, we believe this will change over time. Every L2 will need and benefit from a decentralized stable, and as more and more L2s join the Superchain family, we're excited to service them by bringing a decentralized stable alternative to their chain. The technical feasibility of this is high. The codebase is lindy and is a forked and updated version of the Reflexer/RAI codebase. Our code has already been friendly-forked and deployed on Arbitrum as well. Regarding our team's ability to execute, the protocol achieved its critical milestones from the last grant application almost immediately after launch and has continued to grow since then. Ultimately, success for HAI is staying true to its ethos of providing users (both holders of HAI and borrowers of HAI) a credible alternative to centralized stablecoins. HAI was born to give people a way to borrow against or leverage their LSTs and other accepted collaterals (including OP!) by minting a decentralized stablecoin against it. The livelihood of our protocol depends on our team’s ability to achieve this specific mission-- and we're already delivering results. HAI takes the innovative PI controller mechanic from Reflexer to induce stability, but takes the Reflexer codebase a step further by allowing users to deploy multiple types of collateral, with a heavy focus on LSTs. If you can't tell from our branding, we also took a unique approach to a complex DeFi protocol by making it as memey as possible-- with the intention of abstracting the complexity behind memes. Although this isn’t live yet, we’re not aware of any borrowing market that allows for users to leverage staked Velodrome LP positions.  We’re working diligently on making this possible because it’s a feature we want to see live on Optimism! Yes, the project is open source. Like most other borrowing and leverage venues, the protocol charges nominal fees to borrowers. However, in an analysis of competitors (both on OP and other chains) we believe the protocol offers highly attractive terms to users. Our protocol can onboard any optimism erc-20 token as collateral. Our stablecoin is an erc-20 that is able to integrate with any protocol that can be composed with erc-20s. And our governance is entirely integrated with Tally's protocol on Optimism. Further, we leverage Chainlink and Redstone for oracle services and leverage the benefits of Velodrome for our liquidity  and incentive campaigns.

**Please briefly answer all market analysis questions**

In only 4 months of operation, Let’s Get HAI has become the largest CDP protocol on Optimism, with ~50% of the total CDP TVL on OP in HAI Vaults , 33% larger than the next closest protocol. Our direct competitors are other CDP-backed protocols on Optimism, including Ethos Reserve, QiDAO, Angle, Overnight Finance, Gravita Protocol, and Interest Protocol. We differentiate ourselves via the PI controller that encourages stability for the protocol, and with our commitment to being decentralized and resilient– we build to survive the worst-case scenario– as proven possible by Reflexer/RAI. Our indirect competitors are all stablecoins across all chains– however, we don’t see this as a “winner takes all” game. We believe users deserve optionality and the choice to pick a stable asset with values with which they resonate. Plus, our branding is insane. $4.6 million in collateral has been deposited into 400 vaults, viewable here . And there are 600 HAI holders.

**Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions**

This grant would drive incremental user adoption as the financial incentives provided by this campaign would increase marginal adoption and usage rates.  Combined with marketing efforts from HAI’s DAO, our integration partners, and (hopefully) Optimism itself, we can effectively speak to the audience of potential users about the protocol and its potential benefits. Our target audience are DeFi power users with substantial amounts of LSTs and other assets. However, our protocol is open to anybody, and any user may borrow as little as 150 HAI from deposited collateral. Our users are looking for the best terms when borrowing against their assets, and they care about decentralization.  We aim to offer the best experience for these users as possible. Users will need to bridge their LSTs to Optimism in order to interact with Let's Get HAI.
Once a user has minted HAI on the protocol, they can do just about anything they want on Optimism.  Users can sell their HAI for any other token or use their HAI to provide liquidity on an Optimism DEX like Velodrome. It’s been noted that one vault owner used their vault proceeds to buy a car! Our direct competitors are other CDP-backed protocols on Optimism, including Ethos Reserve, QiDAO, Angle, Overnight Finance, Gravita Protocol, and Interest Protocol.

We intend to continue delivering them these 2 ways with this new grant. Distribution Method 1: provided to users for depositing collateral and minting HAI as well as poviding HAI liquidity on Uni v3 These incentives are calculated monthly and disbursed with a standard merkle distributor contract. The following is an example of how this process is currently done (for WSTETH) and would continue to be done for all of our LSTs (wstETH, rETH, apxETH). The distribution follows the following steps. Run minter and lp scripts to determine which user's deposited how much collateral and how much HAI they minted and how much liquidity they provided. Then calculate the amount of OP they will have earned over the past month distribution period. Minter Scripts Repo: https://github.com/hai-on-op/minter-rewards LP Scripts Repo: https://github.com/hai-on-op/lp-rewards 2. Send amount of OP to be distributed from the grant multisig to the protocol treasury Example of last month's OP incentive distribution: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xd81ae96c5d466592ca49f194dd3fd047ba0ea3e65d1e4c29ce601c1a845e55fc 3. Submit proposal to Tally to deploy a merkle distributor contract for this distribution and transfer the OP that was transferred to the protocol treasury in step 2 to the deployed distributor.

**Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions**

On behalf of the DAO and its plans to continue and improve upon its growth incentive campaign, we request 115,000 OP tokens.  We note that ALL campaigns in which the DAO uses OP tokens will be also eligible for our governance token, KITE.  In this way the DAO feels it has equivalent “skin in the game” when it comes to allocating these incentives. The core functionality of the protocol has been live for approximately four months at the time of this grant.  During this time, we’ve grown our community to be the largest CDP protocol on Optimism, dwarfing the next closest protocol. Further, our liquidity campaigns have very high success alignment with the two largest protocols on Optimism, Velodrome and Synthetix.  HAI’s liquidity campaign incentives have currently caused the HAI/sUSD pool of Velodrome to be the fourth largest sink of sUSD on the entire chain. Further, in the short time since launch, we’ve driven tens of millions of dollars in volume and incentives on Velodrome. This grant will help us execute on our roadmap.  We have two near-term value drivers for the chain, including the onboarding and partnership with Redacted Cartel (and their associated LST) and collateralized Velodrome LP positions.  The partnership with Redacted Cartel is a true example of bringing in NEW TVL to the chain due to its effectively non-zero presence today.  The collateralization and potential leverage opportunity for Velodrome LPs could also be a tremendous value driver for TVL and use-case for users on the chain.
Finally, the DAO team has two long-term roadmap milestones that, if implemented, would be first-of-its-kind features for a CDP protocol (still under wraps for now). The table above describes the DAO’s proposed plans for distributing its token, KITE, along with the OP tokens provided by this grant. This grant would fund incentive operations for the next 200 days and give both DAO contributors and users much-needed safety for planning purposes.  We reiterate that this project was self-funded by members of the DAO and there are no treasury assets besides that of the protocol’s token, KITE, and any funds which we may receive from grants, which are typically earmarked for very specific activities.
The campaigns and their distribution and accountability frameworks are described in detail below. 4.  The DAO plans for this grant to support its incentive campaigns for 200 days following the receipt of funds. 5. We believe that the protocol retains all of its functionality without incentives.  However, these incentives, along with vocal and enthusiastic support from our partners through their marketing channels, has the potential to grow the user base, liquidity, and stability for HAI.  Optimism deserves a trustless, permissionless, overcollateralized stablecoin that is not dependent on the US dollar or funds in someone else’s bank account.  This grant would show that Optimism stands behind 6.

**Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions**

Let's Get HAI gives Optimism users a decentralized method to leverage their LSTs and take out loans against them. No one likes selling their hard-earned tokens, and HAI gives users that needed ability in a way that many find very attractive. Further, users need to have a stablecoin they can trust; we believe we’ve built HAI with that mission first and foremost. Since the protocol offers attractive terms for borrowing against OP, HAI also gives users the ability to borrow against OP received by this grants council. This gives grantees a way to utilize funds without having to sell tokens at potentially inopportune times. Finally, we believe that Optimism, like all chains, needs a truly resilient decentralized stablecoin and we hope to fill that need. HAI brings stablecoin optionality to Optimism, allowing users who want to support decentralization to use a stable that shares their values. HAI attracts LST volume to Optimism, we use incentives to attract LST liquidity into our vaults. ~$2 million of our TVL is LSTs, and we’re actively working with LSTs (currently working with apxETH from Dinero.xyz) that don’t have a strong presence on Optimism to create co-incentive campaigns to bring LST liquidity to the superchain. Funds from this grant will directly encourage bridging of this LST which has virtually zero current presence on Optimism before we began the partnership and integration process. To date, the DAO has pointed the vast majority of its liquidity campaign incentives to Velodrome, driving millions of dollars of TVL for the platform and providing a “sink” for other stables including sUSD from Synthetix and LUSD bridged from mainnnet. These activities increase the user experience and value proposition in a very synergistic way for multiple protocols. Because OP is a collateral type, OP grantees have the ability to collateralize their grants and take loans against them, instead of selling instantly. As the HAI protocol matures, it becomes more trusted and “sticky” for its users. These campaigns attract and lock assets on the platform and emit a stablecoin that is then used across Optimism (e.g., Velodrome) increasing TVL in a multiplicative way. Further, our emerging partnership with an LST provider that has virtually zero current exposure to Optimism will be entirely additive to the ecosystem’s TVL. Every new LST bridged will be added to TVL and most HAI borrowed against that LST will show up in another protocol’s TVL as well. Lastly, we are expecting to roll out a solution for leveraging Velodrome liquidity positions as collateral in the near future.  We believe that this is a core building block to unlocking substantial value for the entire chain and has the potential to again multiply addressable TVL for Optimism. We are committed to exclusively building on and expanding into the Superchain. We believe that building on the Superchain represents our best chance at reaching the widest amount of users with the least technical overhead. We are deployed exclusively on Optimism but have plans to expand to the Superchain, starting with Base.
