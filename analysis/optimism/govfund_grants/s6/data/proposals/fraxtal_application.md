**Is your chain live?**

yes

**Defined Process:**

We are looking for two types of grants: Liquidity Incentives (User Directed): This grant aims to incentivize users of stablecoins, staked ETH tokens, and other targeted assets, attracting Frax’s extensive mainnet user base to the growing Fraxtal DeFi ecosystem. The Frax incentive structure is designed to correlate directly with the TVL and trading volume of pools and vaults within the ecosystem. As TVL and trading activity increase, so do the rewards for liquidity providers. This mutually beneficial relationship stimulates liquidity growth and ecosystem expansion. Frax contributors have developed an automated incentive distribution contract that calculates rewards for targeted pools and distributes incentives efficiently, avoiding error-prone manual processes. Protocol Incentives (Locked): This grant will establish a new program aimed at incentivizing developers and protocols to deploy or integrate with Fraxtal. The primary focus will be on attracting analytics tools and off-chain protocols into the Fraxtal ecosystem. This open-ended grant program will allow protocols to apply either through the standard Frax Finance governance process or by directly engaging with the Frax Finance Core team. By offering these incentives, we aim to foster innovation and expand the range of services available within the Fraxtal ecosystem.

**Defined Decision Makers**

Frax Finance Core Team will be decision makers about liquidity incentives: Sam Kazemian: Core Team Member / Co-Founder
Travis Moore: Core Team Member / Co-Founder
Justin Moore: Core Team Member
Dennis: Core Team Mamber
Alex: Core Team Member
Nader Ghazvini: Core Team Member / Head of Governance and Integration and Frax Finance Governance for decisions related to locked incentives for developers.

**Defined Mandate:**

The goals and objectives of the grants program are: Increasing Total Value Locked (TVL) on Fraxtal: Provide incentives to attract more liquidity providers and assets to Fraxtal. Stimulate growth in TVL by supporting high-value liquidity pools and vaults. Attracting New Protocols: Encourage the development and deployment of new protocols on Fraxtal. Offer milestone-based incentives to developers for launching and scaling their projects on Fraxtal. Attracting New Users and Holders: Design targeted campaigns to attract users from specific categories, such as stablecoin holders and ETH stakers. Provide user-directed incentives to encourage participation and engagement within the Fraxtal ecosystem. These objectives aim to create a robust and dynamic ecosystem on Fraxtal, driving sustainable growth and innovation.

**Grant Policies:**

yes

**KYC information requirement:**

yes

**Intent #3B Alignment:**

The grants program will empower Fraxtal to accelerate its growth and enhance scalability significantly. With this grant, Fraxtal can strategically leverage it to attract additional projects to its platform, boost Total Value Locked (TVL), and expand its user base on the Superchain. A primary goal of this grant is to foster the growth of developers and projects launching on Fraxtal, thereby enriching Superchain ecosystem.

**OP Chain Contribution:**

Fraxtal, as a growing member of the Collective, significantly enhances the Superchain ecosystem with its increasing Total Value Locked (TVL) and volume, positioning itself as a key hub for stablecoins and ETH derivatives. This growth boosts the overall liquidity and stability of the Superchain. With a decentralized banking structure, Fraxtal ensures trust and transparency, aligning its development with the Collective's goals and fostering a more inclusive and dynamic ecosystem. Moreover, Fraxtal has secured an agreement for a 2% share of sequencer revenue with the Superchain. This arrangement not only provides a continuous revenue stream to support the ecosystem but also exemplifies our commitment to contributing to the overall health and sustainability of the Superchain. By sharing sequencer revenue, Fraxtal helps ensure that the Collective can continue to grow and thrive, benefiting all members involved.

**Grants Allocation Framework:**

We are looking for two types of grants: Liquidity Incentives (User Directed):
Incentives would be distributed toward pools and vaults within any protocol upon technical review and approval by the team. The underlying liquidity within each pool should be as follows: USD Stablecoins and derivatives ETH Stablecoins and derivatives Any other assets upon approval Protocol Incentives (Locked): This grant will be a brand new grant program, which will be distributed between developers or protocols that deploy or integrate with Fraxtal, this budget will mostly focus to bring more analytics, and off-chain protocols into Fraxtal ecosystem. This program would be an open-ended grant program and protocols can apply for that either through Frax Finance standard Governance process or directly convince Frax Finance Core team.

**Target Metrics:**

Growth: TVL in the grantee’s protocol Number of transactions emitting event logs Number of active addresses FXTL Points Stickiness: Percentage of retained active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts

**Milestones:**

TVL Milestones: $1 Billion TVL by End of 2024: The goal is to reach $1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) before the end of 2024. This target is achievable through the issuance of all Frax Assets on Fraxtal as well as creating a hub for exchange and borrow USD and ETH Stablecoins and derivatives. Transaction Volume Milestones: 100,000 Average Transactions per Day by End of 2024: The aim is to reach an average of 100,000 transactions per day by the end of 2024. This goal will be supported by the increasing use of Frax Assets on Fraxtal, driving higher transaction volumes across the ecosystem. (Milestones for this grant are specified in detail on Milestones section)

**Impact Analysis:**

Impact Assessment:

The impact of the grants program will be assessed through a combination of key performance indicators (KPIs), periodic reviews, and continuous monitoring. The primary metrics for assessment will include TVL, transaction volumes, user engagement, and protocol adoption rates. Specific milestones will serve as benchmarks for success.

Reporting:

To ensure transparency and accountability, the following reporting mechanisms will be implemented:

Monthly Reports: Detailed monthly reports will be provided, outlining the progress of the grants program, the utilization of funds, and the achievement of key milestones. These reports will include data on TVL growth, transaction volumes, and other relevant KPIs.

Real-Time Dashboard: A real-time dashboard will be available for stakeholders to monitor the grants program's performance continuously. This dashboard will provide up-to-date information on TVL, transaction volumes, and other key metrics, ensuring full transparency.

Example of Reporting:

For reference, we have implemented similar reporting mechanisms for the Arbitrum STIP grant for liquidity incentivization grant. An example of this reporting can be found bellow. This example showcases our commitment to transparency and detailed reporting. https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/frax-finance-bi-weekly-update-final-update/22960 

**Token Delivery:**

Tokens will be distributed via the grant program through two main types of incentives: Liquidity Incentives (User Directed) and Protocol Incentives (Locked). 

Liquidity incentives will be allocated for USD stablecoins and derivatives, ETH stablecoins and derivatives, and other approved assets. Distribution will be automated and correlated with TVL and trading volume to stimulate growth. 

Protocol incentives will be milestone-based, rewarding projects for achieving specific TVL, transaction volume, and other KPIs defined by the Frax team. The process will be transparent, with regular reports and a real-time dashboard, ensuring compliance with grant policies and fair distribution based on performance. 

**Sustainability:**

This grant will help kickstart our DeFi ecosystem by providing the initial funding needed to grow and attract users and liquidity. Once established, our financial products and subprotocols will begin generating revenue through lending yields, staking reward, and protocol fees. This will create a sustainable income stream, allowing the grants program to continue supporting innovation and growth within the Fraxtal ecosystem without relying solely on external funding.
