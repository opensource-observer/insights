**What is this project going to build?**

Why is what they are going to build novel or valuable to Optimism? Our project introduces a novel approach to yield-earning protocol design, enhancing end-user security in DeFi. By creating new incentive structures, we aim to bridge the gap between users and threat detection tools, security actors, and MEV searchers without compromising user experience or yield-earning potential. Earn Guardian addresses the need for seamless security layers for retail users earning yield on idle on-chain assets. This aligns with Optimism's mission – and that of partners like Base and Zora – to bring more users on-chain effortlessly. Furthermore, we think Earn Guardian would have proven most useful by protecting users' funds in hacks that affected Optimisms' users and our co-founders personally: Exactly and Sonne's. Additionally, we've implemented our vault architecture from scratch with the core focus on making it as flexible as possible, so other projects can take advantage of our novel implementation. In addition to the flexibility, we've designed the architecture to be highly scalable. Last, but not least our protocol is user friendly and does not require any advanced knowledge. Technological Superiority: Our project has a substantial likelihood of generating long-term, sustainable value for the Optimism ecosystem due to the user friendliness and our superior technology including: Modularized Yield Earning Vaults: Our implemented architecture aligns with lessons learned from leading lending markets (Morpho, AaveV4, EulerV2) by modularizing different component types of yield-earning vaults. By splitting concerns into separate smart contracts, we enable a variety of new permissionless behaviors and integrations. Single-Asset Multiple Rewards Vaults: In contrast to all known vault designs, our architecture allows for tracking shares of multiple rewards per deposit. This enables non-compounding strategies or percentage-based compounding strategies. For example, users could keep 30% of liquidity mined assets and auto-compound the remaining 70%, offering a new and flexible platform in which yield-earning strategies can be implemented. Permissionless Core: The core of our vault architecture allows for permissionless integration of any strategy without relying on allowlists or denylists. This empowers asset managers to focus on creating their strategies without getting bogged down in the complexities of implementing shares, deposit, withdrawal, or delayed withdrawal systems. Well Tested Architecture: We've prioritized robust testing to ensure reliability and security. Our codebase has rigorous testing implemented, including multiple invariant tests, fuzz tests, parameterized unit tests, and integration tests. Template Strategies: Our repository will include open-source implementations of template strategies for popular protocols like AaveV2, AaveV3, Compound, and Lido (with more to come afterwards). These templates serve as a starting point for developers, accelerating the process of creating new strategies and fostering innovation within the ecosystem. Direct competitors: Direct competitors for Earn itself include yield aggregators like Superform, Beefy, Yearn, and Harvest, but our unique Guardian feature sets us apart. How is this project likely to bring and keep new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? We believe our novel yield-earning architecture will create a new wave of yield-related products on Superchain's chains. Its modularized, permissionless, and well-tested nature allows for flexible integrations and new product development. Furthermore, our proposed "Guardians" approach can spark new security-related conversations and discussions on the decentralization threshold, particularly in areas like Sequencer security and transaction analysis. What are some comparable projects? What differentiates this one? Without the Guardian's architecture, earn-core is a more, better-tested modularized architecture for yield-earning vaults, allowing new things like separate tracking of base yield on a base asset and token rewards. Comparable yield-earning projects include Superform, Beefy, Yearn, Harvest, and other yield-aggregator platforms. Moreover, we are not aware of any project implementing an architecture similar to our proposed Guardian's architecture. Service providers: have you worked with similar projects as this one? Will this project be fee-based or free to the end user? This project has at its core a vault allowing anyone to deploy strategies with their desired fee: zero fee, 10%, etc., making free-to-use strategies entirely possible. However, we expect all strategies listed on our frontend to be curated and have some kind of fee. Will this project pay for any portion of the service? No. Will this project be open-source? Yes, the code will be public with an MIT license.

**Who are the founders? please cover:**

Our team has a proven track record of securely launching products on Optimism, including Mean Finance over three years ago and other high-profile projects. This product is our full-time focus, and we're committed to its ongoing development and improvement for years to come. With us, you're choosing a team that combines expertise with unwavering commitment to deliver and maintain a top-tier product. Alejo Amiras: A veteran in the crypto industry with diverse experience under various pseudonyms. In 2017, Alejo founded Experimental (e11), a decentralized gaming company in Argentina. Following a brief stint at The Sandbox, he joined Yearn Finance, where he spent over a year as part of the crucial yet low-profile yMechanics team, focusing on automation, the keep3r network, and other cool projects. Last, but not least he was one of the early founders of Wonderland (defi.sucks). Co-founded Mean Finance (now Balmy) in 2021. Nico Chamo: With a strong background in customer experience, Nico spent over four years at Medallia before transitioning to web3. In 2019, he joined Decentraland, where he played a key role in developing their decentralized content storage, SDK, and P2P connection system. Nico's contributions extend to Uniswap v3 oracle libraries, and he co-founded Mean Finance (now Balmy) in 2021. Fiboape: With six years of experience at Medallia, Fiboape honed his skills in web apps and infrastructure development before co-founding Mean Finance in 2021. He leads our frontend and web infra efforts, bringing all his practical knowledge to the team. Furthermore, his contributions to the DeFi space extend beyond our project - he's made significant impacts on Yearn's Web Team, particularly in areas like allowlist functionality and zapper integration. Additionally he contributed to Zapper's studio, developing tools and integrations.

**Is this project funded?**

Is this project funded? * Yes, we successfully completed a pre-seed funding round over a year ago, providing us with the initial capital to develop our vision.

**Has this project been the subject of a security breach?**

Has this project been the subject of a security breach? * Balmy (fka Mean Finance) has been live for almost 3 years. We haven't had any security breaches exploited, but we've had some reports through ImmuneFi that we publicly patched (paused previous version on the protocol + migration).

**Do you anticipate any particular issues or complexity in providing services to this project?**

none from spearbit/cantina

**Please provide details from your due diligence on this project and audit scope (the due diligence must contain the complexity of the scope, test coverage, and test methodologies applied to the scope)**

We will be reviewing the Core and Periphery — with "all folders under src" (all solidity code) being included. core repo: https://github.com/Balmy-protocol/earn-core periph repo: https://github.com/Balmy-protocol/earn-periphery Project will be paying 25k for this engagement alongside the OP support.

**Optimism alignment**

Our alignment with Optimism runs deep and long-standing (almost 3 years): We've been committed to Optimism since our beta V2 deployment in early July of 2022, showcasing our early recognition of the platform's potential. We were part of the first cohort of Kain Warwick's incubated projects on Optimism in July 2022, highlighting our strategic importance within the ecosystem. Our project received $OP tokens during Phase 1 of Optimism's Governance Fund, underscoring the Optimism community's confidence in our vision and potential. We demonstrate our commitment to the Optimism ecosystem by ensuring all our products are enabled on one or more chains within the Superchain. Notably, Earn Guardian's inaugural deployment and go-to-market strategy is focused on a "Superchain, Supersafe" narrative: being deployed on Optimism, Base and Mode from the start; further solidifying our alignment with the Optimism ecosystem and its partners. Through these initiatives and our continued development efforts, we've wanted to deliver significant value to the Optimism ecosystem, fostering user adoption, and contributing to the overall growth of the network and its users. links: https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-mean-finance/2537?u=0xged https://x.com/kaiynne/status/1531421576175882241

**What does this audit unlock for the project?**

What does this audit unlock for the project?* This audit process is key to the success of the project as Earn Guardian centers around the safety of users' funds, and we hope to attract millions in total value locked. An amazing security-focused project is nothing if the code has not been audited by the best. Furthermore, we'd love for this implementation to be forked, tweaked, re-deployed by other teams that are looking to create some kind of yield-related product. Making it the de-facto vault architecture. As a small funded company from Argentina with a clear focus on creating valuable products for end consumer users we try to achieve as much as we can with as little as possible; not to embellish ourselves, but to be able to (as a start-up) live as long as we can and help bring web3 closer to the masses as possible.
