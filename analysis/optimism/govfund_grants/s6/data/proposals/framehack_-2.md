**Please briefly answer all project details questions**

FrameTrain is Canva for Frames. ( 2 min demo ) Normal ("normie") Farcaster users have no need a way to create and host Frames without becoming developers. There is no Canva or Vercel for Frames, which means a significant void in the market and a clear need for such a solution. Frames are experimental by nature, and FrameTrain is experimenting with building a platform for building said Frames. A OSS (1), No-code (2), Revenue Sharing (3) platform for creating Frames (4). Yes, FrameTrain — the project behind FrameHack — is already fully Open Source. Free tier with optional fee for additional features. At the moment everything is free, and will remain free for the foreseeable future. There is no plan to add a premium tier until a solid amount of features are introduced. Project will remain Open Source either way, same as NextJS (open source) & Vercel (platform). It's the Frames builder, so by nature it's composable with the Farcaster protocol, and all clients like Warpcast.

**Please briefly answer all market analysis questions**

There are no 1:1 competitors to FrameTrain, the space is still new and very much experimental. The only similar product is a very basic Frames builder built by Neynar which looks like this: It lets you build only simple slideshows, compared to FrameTrain which (as of now) allows you to create Cal, Medium, Figma, Form, Presentation, Quiz, and Tweet Frames just to name a few. Each one of these templates is a mini app in and of itself, the Figma template lets you use actual Figma artboards to create Frames — and even edit their contents. ~700 Frames created in total, taken from Vercel and Turso stats.

**Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions**

Organize a hackathon for template artists/devs > Devs create useful Frame templates > These templates fill the utility gap needed by protocol users > Users create Frames and end up using the Farcaster protocol more. Developers who not only want to create Frames for the sake of experimenting with the concept, but also want to earn for their work. Developers who have no way of marketing their Frames, which make up almost all developers. Very rarely does a developer has a "fanbase" or "audience" to market things to. This is very similar to Gumroad (marketplace) and Notion template creators. Users will be interacting directly with an Optimism native protocol, Farcaster. N/A Templates created during the first edition of FrameHack:

**Fill out your metric objective**

As seen by the Farcaster Dune dashboard @ https://dune.com/pixelhack/farcaster, the launch of Frames on 01/26/2024 has skyrocketed the growth of the protocol, making the metrics before the launch look like a blip.

This piece of backstory is important because we have to note that all of the growth happened while Farcaster users created (and still create) Frames by stitching various frameworks and libraries together. Developers have started building on top of existing frameworks and created easier way to create Frames, but still only for developers and technical people alike. To put this into perspective and provide an example for the difficulty of creating Frames: no matter how easy to use a specific framework is, you still have to host the Frame yourself on a VPS (server) or similar hosting solution. The growth of Frames is severely hindered by the lack of a UI first solution to build these Frames that also integrates hosting under the hood w/out the user having to do _anything_ extra.

FrameTrain has made that possible, but the road ahead has just begun. The next steps are to integrate more templates (achieved through FrameHack and this proposal) and to make the existence of our solution known to current users, they will in turn share these new and useful type of interactions with non Farcaster users (either on platforms like Twitter, or direct sharing with their friends).

We envision a 10x growth of the Farcaster protocol through a solution like FrameTrain. This is not a downplayed, nor an exaggerated factor of growth. The protocol has grown in revenue 10x already (from under ~$200,000 to over ~$2M revenue) after the launch of Frames (given all current barriers of entry noted above). We also see a considerable amount of new accounts & transactions on Optimism and related OP Stack chains, each for various reasons. 

Sources of transactions for the Optimism chain
- Registering a FID (creating an account)
- Buying storage units (needed to be able to cast/react/follow on Farcaster)

Sources of transactions for Base, Zora & related chains
- Minting (supported natively in Frames)
- Swapping (through Frames that enable that)
- Attestations (through the Ethereum Attestation Service)
- Various contract interactions


METRICS OBJECTIVE
1 —— With ~1,150 users registering on Farcaster every 24 hours ( https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x00000000fc04c910a0b5fea33b03e0447ad0b0aa), we expect this number to at least double after FrameHack #2 ends and FrameTrain exits stealth mode (i.e. starts outreach and marketing, which is outside of this proposal and the sole responsibility of FrameTrain to do).

2 —— Given that Base is the preferred network on Warpcast and clients alike for making transactions, we estimate that 0.5% of all Base transactions will come from Frames created on FrameTrain, which means around 1,600 tx per day. 

**Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions**

We are requesting a grant of 2,000 OP tokens for incentivizing the creation of new and useful Frame templates during the second edition of FrameHack , a hackathon for Frames creators. The guidebook for running FrameHack will be the same as FrameHack #1, which was held on Dora. This edition will be held directly on Github, due to the feedback received in the first edition regarding friction. You can see the details of FrameHack #1 right here: github.com/FTCHD/frametrain/wiki/%5BHACKATHONS%5D-FrameHack-%231 100% of tokens will be distributed to participants . 1st place receives the equivalent of $1,500 in OP tokens, 2nd place receives $1,000, 3rd place receives $500, and starting from 4th place $250 per winner. This is different from the first edition, where prizes for the first 3 places were a bit higher, but we found such high amounts are not needed and it's better to reward more participants fewer amounts. Given the fact that creators will continue to earn when their template is used on FrameTrain, hackathon rewards should only be a minor incentive and more like a "nudge" in the right direction. It's also very important to note that the winner of FrameHack #1 has implemented a full fledged Figma editor inside FrameTrain, so while the first place award may seem high "for a Frame" (even when reduced for FrameHack #2), these are not just Frames (they're reusable templates) and a lot of work goes into the best of them. You're creating an app inside another app, making sure it works on mobile and desktop, is accessible and has a seamless UX, and is thoroughly customizable. FrameHack is planned for sometime in September. The duration is 10 days (to fill up 2 weekends and a week), and rewards are distributed after the verification period, which ends about 1 week after the hackathon finishes. In essence the duration is at max 1 month from the start of the hackathon until all participants have the rewards in their wallets. By nature of FrameHack participation guidelines, only sustainable value is awarded. This means we have a strong bias for Frame templates with provable reusability and utility, as opposed to novel and one-use templates. As the "Canva for Frames" platform, templates that are first and foremost useful are not only encouraged, but needed, for the Farcaster and Frames ecosystem to thrive. The only address used by FrameTrain is "0xe7910f8A4b7eFCf2964F017e34e4E2D9AA06EDc3". Rewards from FrameHack will go directly from this address to participants wallets. Criterion for choosing FrameHack Winners code is open source code is not copied or infringes any license re-use potential of the submitted template (is it a one-time or seasonal thing, or an evergreen one like "booking a call") does it have an onchain factor (templates that utilize any onchain mechanic are prioritized) complexity of the template (was this template harder to build than another one? does it allow for vastly more functionality? eg. the Figma template which is like a mini Figma editor for Frames vs the Medium template that turns any article into a Frame, with the first one being considerably harder to execute) how known is the template creator (if the creator already has some sort of following on farcaster, that helps bring a boost of usage to their template) The first 2 are requirements to enter the judging phase. The next 3 (re-use potential, onchain component, complexity) are the actual factors we look at when deciding the winner, with the last one (popularity) being a bonus in situations where the competition is tight.

**Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions**

Solving the utility gap for Frames, the primitive created by Farcaster, a protocol residing on Optimism. More Frames for Farcaster. Not only more Frames, but useful Frames, things that you actually find yourself reaching for. More usage of the Farcaster protocol, therefore more usage of Optimism and related chains such as Zora and Base. Farcaster lives on Optimism, so naturally FrameTrain and the templates built at FrameHack too. We cannot move to another network even if we wanted to, and we definitely don't want to leave the Superchain. Exclusively on Optimism, due to the nature of the Farcaster protocol.

**Contributions from non-team members:**

Merke Manufactory (creators of Farcaster) have awarded FrameTrain (organizers of FrameHack) $500 in their retro grants round. The small amount is due to FrameTrain being 1 week old at the time, so there was almost no retroactive activity to award for. 

This is the announcement from Varun Srinivasan, co-founder of Farcaster.
