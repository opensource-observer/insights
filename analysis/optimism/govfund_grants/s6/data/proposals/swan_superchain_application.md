The Swan Grant Platform connects grant makers with builders and researchers in the Swan community. The Grants Council serves by delegation from Token House. The Grants Council exists to: create a more streamlined and consistent process for proposers set a pace for grant distributions define a clear scope, with clear differentiation from Partner Fund create accountability via smaller grant sizes and milestone-based distributions Open Grant Grants of $5,000 in Swan are available to support those taking the next step after creating an initial prototype with Swan technologies. Requests for Proposals (RFPs) RFPs are grants for specific development work. As the name suggests, we are requesting proposals from teams that want to complete the work specified in each RFP. In these grants, we generally have clearly scoped deliverables, milestones, and funding limits. Some RFPs will ask you to propose your own milestones and funding needs. While there is some flexibility in RFP deliverables, we expect teams will deliver what is in scope in the RFP. Any deviations from the specified scope must be approved between your team and ours before we can approve funding.

**Sustainability:**

1. Revenue Generation for Ongoing Support
a. Yield-Bearing Assets and TVL Growth
Strategy: As SwanChain successfully increases Total Value Locked (TVL) through high-yield DeFi projects and cross-chain asset integrations, the platform will generate revenue from transaction fees, yield farming, and liquidity provision.
Implementation: A portion of the revenue generated from these activities will be reinvested into the grants program, creating a self-sustaining model. For example, achieving the target of $50M in TVL will significantly increase transaction fees and yields, which can be partially allocated to fund future grants.

b. Gas Fees and Transaction Volume
Strategy: The deployment of new projects on SwanChain, particularly those involving high-frequency transactions and complex smart contracts, will generate significant gas fees. These fees will contribute to the overall revenue of the platform.
Implementation: As SwanChain reaches its goal of generating 2,500 ETH in gas fees over 12 months, a portion of these fees can be redirected to the grants fund. This approach ensures that as the platform grows, the grants program benefits from increased economic activity.

2. Strategic Partnerships and Co-Funding
a. Collaboration with Ecosystem Partners
Strategy: SwanChain will establish partnerships with other projects, organizations, and stakeholders within the OP Superchain. These partnerships can provide co-funding opportunities, shared resources, and collaborative ventures that enhance the grants program.
Implementation: By working with ecosystem partners, SwanChain can access additional funding pools, secure matching grants, or receive in-kind contributions that support the program’s sustainability.

b. Community-Driven Fundraising and DAO Involvement
Strategy: SwanChain may explore the creation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to manage and sustain the grants program. The DAO would allow community members to contribute funds and participate in decision-making.
Implementation: A DAO structure can enable ongoing community-driven fundraising, where contributors are incentivized to support the grants program. This approach ensures that the program remains aligned with the community’s needs and interests.

3. Reintegration of Profits from Successful Projects
a. Revenue Sharing and Reinvestment
Strategy: SwanChain will encourage successful grant-funded projects that generate revenue to reinvest a portion of their profits back into the grants program. This creates a cyclical model of funding where successful initiatives support the next wave of innovation.
Implementation: Grant agreements can include provisions for profit-sharing or reinvestment commitments from projects that achieve commercial success. This reinvestment helps to replenish the grants fund and supports the continuous development of the ecosystem.

4. Continuous Monitoring and Program Optimization
a. Performance-Based Adjustments
Strategy: The grants program will be continuously monitored and adjusted based on the performance of funded projects and the overall health of the OP Superchain ecosystem.
Implementation: Regular evaluations and feedback loops will inform decisions on reallocating funds, adjusting grant criteria, or scaling successful initiatives. This dynamic approach ensures that the program remains responsive and sustainable over time.

5. Long-Term Ecosystem Support and Engagement
a. Developer and Community Engagement
Strategy: Sustained engagement with developers and the broader community is essential for the long-term success of the grants program. SwanChain will continue to invest in educational initiatives, hackathons, and community-building activities that keep the ecosystem vibrant and innovative.
Implementation: Ongoing support for developer education, mentorship programs, and community events will help maintain high levels of participation and innovation within the OP Superchain. This engagement is crucial for the continuous generation of new project ideas and grant applications.
