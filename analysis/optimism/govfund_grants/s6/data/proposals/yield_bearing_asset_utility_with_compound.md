Compound is the Oldest DeFi protocol in the industry, with around $2.5Bn in TVL. Compound is an EVM-compatible protocol that enables the supplying of crypto assets as collateral in order to borrow the base asset. Accounts can also earn interest by supplying the base asset to the protocol. The protocol helps users of yield-bearing tokens in getting the best out of their assets. Currently Compound has a majority of the top Yield bearing assets listed as collaterals. With the Optimism mission for dominance in Yield bearing assets in L2s, the utility offered by Compound for YBA assets is key in making this adoption permanent. Compound already is heavily tapping on the userbase of wstETH and looking to integrate rETH, USDM and more. Success Potential Compound is the oldest Defi protocol in Web3. This has created a battle tested infrastructure that is known to be successful. Compound already has immense market demand on Ethereum mainnet with more than $1Billion of assets locked on Compound mainnet. Lending protocols form one of the core pillars of Defi, Compound being a household name for Defi veterans and beginners alike becomes the preferred choice of traders to make use of their idle assets. Compound has substantial runway to keep our operations going on Optimism. Compound Treasury has more than $100M in reserves that finances multiple top tier teams like Gauntlet, AlphaGrowth, OpenZeppelin to ensure the protocol's continued success. Compound being a truly decentralized organization is run by multiple reputed teams to ensure the success to the Protocol. Gauntlet is the Risk management team for Compound, OpenZeppelin provides Security and AlphaGrowth leads the Growth for the protocol. Over the past 3 months, Compound Community has deployed the protocol to the Optimism ecosystem and the protocol has already reached the list of top 10 defi protocols on Optimism. Mission Alignment Compound supported Yield bearing assets on Optimism from day 1 of deployment. We already started with wstETH, rETH and are in talks with Stader and Mountain Protocol. A big problem that LST assets in general have suffered till now is utility, wstETH till now had little avenues to be utilized. So the ability to borrow assets like ETH and stablecoins by using LSTs as collateral was crucial for LST success. In this regard, the Compound helps the LST assets with this capability and solves the utility issue for these LST projects. Novelty Compound is a pioneer in Defi Lending. Compound's code and model has been forked by multiple projects in Web3. The latest version of Compound, Compound III is one step ahead in Defi novelty. Compound III utilizes the technology of separate markets for assets, called Comets. These comets, unlike the existing double asset supply/borrow earning, focus on the base asset for supply and earn. This makes Compound Markets more capital efficient compared to the competition. This also ensures that Compound markets are not cannibalistic among themselves, ultimately ensuring its long term success within the ecosystem. OpenSource Yes the Project is fully open source. You can find more details here : https://github.com/compound-finance Free or fee-based for end users? Compound is completely free for use by users. Anyone with an internet connection and a functioning browser on device can access the Compound app without any paywall. Is it composable with other projects on Optimism? How? The success of Compound in Optimism ultimately depends on the success of other projects in Optimism, similarly Compound contributes to the success of projects within the ecosystem. For example, in terms of asset issuers, the more popular an asset is on Optimism, the higher its usage will be on Compound, alternatively Compound is one of the first avenues of adoption of many of the LST assets. LST projects can directly integrate in Compound and benefit from its brand and widespread usage. For other DeFi protocols and structured products, Compound pools create a base infrastructure on which structured products can be built. Top Dapps like Instadapp, Cian, Sommelier utilize Compound pools. Talks are in progress to integrate with more Dapps within the Optimism ecosystem.

**Please briefly answer all market analysis questions**

Current Competitors for Compound include all the Lending protocols on Optimism. Some of these include Aave, Silo and Exactly. Compound’s battle tested infrastructure, reliability and ease of use makes it the preferred choice for Defi users. Moreover, the ability of Compound to bring mainstream Dapps from Mainnet to OP for integration makes it an ideal partner within the OP ecosystem. Currently, Compound has more than 3500 active users on the Optimism Markets, and as many as 6000 active users in the last few months. The user base estimation is referenced from Gauntlet statistics. Currently the USDC market is the most popular market for Compound on Optimism with 3500 active wallets. Here is the link to data source Two more markets USDT and ETH have been recently deployed and are slowly gaining traction within the community. The user base for these markets is still in the nascent stages and expanding.

**Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions**

The grant will serve two key objectives: Enhance the borrowability of LST assets by incentivizing lending, which will increase the supply of base assets. Encourage borrowing of LSTs by directly reducing Borrow APRs on LST assets within Compound markets. By balancing these two objectives, the goal is to achieve high utilization across Compound markets. Incentivising Supply Ideally, half of the grant will be allocated to boost Compound’s ETH market on Optimism. While Compound already incentivizes this market with COMP tokens, adding OP rewards will further encourage the supply of base assets, thereby lowering the borrow rates for LST users leveraging ETH for staking purposes. The ultimate aim is to increase the supply of ETH available for LST users. For distribution of the supply side incentives, Compound will partner with OP ecosystem projects like dHedge, Cian, Layer3, Vaultcraft, OKX Defi, Crypto.com defi wallet to boost the supplies for LRT users. The actual execution strategy of the partner distribution depends on the supply capability of the partner at the given time, so it cannot be predicted in advance. Incentivising Borrow For borrow-side incentives, the OP grant will be directly used to reward users who supply LST assets. This will effectively reduce the borrow APR of base assets on Optimism compared to the same base assets on Mainnet for Compound, encouraging users to borrow and utilize LST strategies more on Optimism. We expect this approach to drive users and capital from Mainnet to Optimism. Target Audience Lido Users LST Projects Structured Products General Defi Users Lido Users Lido alone captures the largest market share among LST assets- this is also true for asset dynamics on Compound. Primary target for the strategies will be Lido users, due to the sheer size and demand of wstETH on Compound. A screenshot of Collateral assets on Compound for ETH market on Mainnet. wstETH outperforms the next LST (rETH) by a factor of 5. Compound is already working closely with the Lido community to provide an avenue to Lido users for wstETH utility. This grant will open up another dimension for closer collaboration with Lido community. More LST Projects Compound is also the preferred choice of projects like Frax (sfrxETH), Rocketpool (rETH), Stader (ETHx). While RocketPool is already listed on Compound, this grant will be used to boost the borrowing of Rocketpool LST. Stader’s ETHx is currently not deployed on Optimism, we are working closely with them on timelines of deployment. Structured Product Users Compound has deep integrations with top structured products and other Defi protocols. Protocols like Cian, dHedge, Veda, Sommelier have live integrations with Compound and actively utilize Compound pools. These products also turn out to be the most reliable users of the protocol so Compound will be working closely with these products ETH/WETH User base All users of WETH will in theory will be eligible to avail the incentives from our OP grant. We will also be launching marketing campaigns to amplify this on our end.

**Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions**

Budget The budget for this grant is based on previous experiences with similar initiatives. Generally, incentives above $50K have a significant impact on Compound markets, for this we are ideally targeting all 3 Compound Markets- ETH, USDC and USDT for LST collaterals (This may change in fovor of ETH market as the ETH Market has the most potential for ETH based LSTs). Since this grant aims to serve two purposes—supply-side and borrow-side incentivizations—we believe that a request of 180,000 OP is the right amount to satisfy the completion Under ideal circumstances, the grant will be split equally to incentivize both the supply and demand of the ETH market, fostering optimal conditions for LST utilization. However, the scales will be slightly tipped towards supply to naturally lower borrowing APRs. If market dynamics shift—favoring either borrowing or supply as can happen with incentivized markets—we will adjust the strategy to strengthen the dominant side as needed. Grant Distribution Plan The Grant distribution roadmap will span over a period of 4 months or over 8 biweekly periods.
Compound uses a biweekly system to distribute grants so that at the end of each biweekly, we can recalibrate our strategies and improvise. The above image depicts the planned 16 week roadmap for the Grant distribution. Within all the weeks, supplying ETH is an action that will be consistently supported with the Grants. Beyond that, we will keep changing strategies to incentivising borrowing of different LSTs on ETH market and Stablecoin yield bearing assets on USDT markets. Sustainability post-incentives A big part of our grants push will be distributing the incentives through structured products like vaults and strategies. Historically, structured products have provided the stickiest TVL on Compound. Additionally this also scales to 10s of millions of dollars compared to individual users on Compound who will also be incentivized through native rewards of Compound. Compound has its own 100M treasury and we have target incentive deployment as COMP tokens from our treasury as incentives on Optimism. Additional accountability info (smart contract addresses, wallet addresses, etc.): The Compound Growth Program is directly accountable to the Compound DAO for any usage of funds. All of the fund interactions happen with publicly verifiable SAFE multisig.

**Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions**

Compound’s lending pools provide a trusted avenue for individual users and institutional investors alike to earn interest on their otherwise idle assets. Compound itself is a profitable protocol with last year’s revenue at around $6.5 Million, mostly on Ethereum Mainnet. Compound’s markets provide an excellent opportunity for users of mainstream assets like USDT, USDC, ETH to deposit their assets. Interestingly, these assets are the dominating assets on Ethereum Mainnet, so having an avenue for earning interest on these on Optimism opens a direct path to transfer Compound’s mainnet liquidity to Optimism. Compound DAO and the Compound growth program have been committed to make the protocol a success on Optimism. To ensure success, Compound DAO has also committed a part of its COMP treasury to be deployed as user incentives for OP users. Currently we have deployed 3 markets on Optimism, we aim to keep building new collateral integrations and add more structured products to make Compound a well-connected Dapp within the Optimism Ecosystem. Compound is primarily deployed on Ethereum Mainnet with USDC market as a base market. Beyond that Compound is deployed to L2s such as Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, Scroll.
