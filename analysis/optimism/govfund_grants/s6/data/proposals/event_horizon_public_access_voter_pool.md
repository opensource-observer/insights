**Please briefly answer all project details questions**

Event Horizon is a public good. Event Horizon onboards sidelined, retail DAO community members into governance, starting with voting. All governance authority delegated to Event Horizon is given to Optimism community members who mint a free soul-bound NFT Voter Pass. Whenever Optimism has a proposal (be it a temperature check or an on-chain vote), Voter Pass holders vote on how the entire block votes, thereby giving retail voters a non-monetary incentive to vote (typically >$10,000 of voting authority thanks to our novel governance mechanism called Implicit Delegation: https://medium.com/hvax/implicit-delegation-event-horizons-governance-solution-3815d61ded12?source=collection_home---2------1-----------------------). While previously someone with, say, $50 of OP tokens might make the (unfortunately rational) decision to not vote, Event Horizon provides an entry point into tapping into this 99% of sidelined retail voice,all under a seamless UX (no need to jump through different governance platforms to vote). Eventually, we aim to further gamify the experience: think Duolingo for governance.
Crucially, the grant will be used in a novel way: instead of liquidity mining incentives, they will be distributed to people who delegate to the Event Horizon Public Access Voter Pool which is then entirely given back to the Optimism community. This serves 3 functions: i) Surfacing dormant thought capital: by allowing small DAO citizens to dictate how the Event Horizon public good voter pools vote, this gives non-monetary incentive for sidelined DAO citizens to finally start participating and getting used to participating in DAO governance. Think of this as the first step in a DAO contributor pipeline. ii) Distribution of Cognition: Governance is hard. It is nearly impossible to review, react to, and care about every individual proposal. Event Horizon functions as a hive mind to solve this problem. If there are 3 proposals (Gaming, Lending, and Partnership) 100 citizens may show up to vote for each, but the exact voter body may be entirely different each time: Those who care about gaming vote on the gaming proposal, those interested in lending vote on lending, etc. In fact, Event Horizon is working on a solution to leverage self-selection as a mode of driving the identification and magnification of subject matter experts through a process coined sacrificial specialization (https://medium.com/hvax/sacrificial-specialization-7538c067674c). iii) Preventing non-participatory delegations: One of the most pervasive issues in governance today is the ‘Satoshi Delegate’. Because of the set-and-forget nature of delegating, it is incredibly common that absolutely massive sums of voting power were delegated to wallets which are no longer active. It is not uncommon to see as little as 5% of the top 100 most highly delegated wallets participate in governance in the past twelve months. The voting power entrusted to them is now fully non-productive and effectively permanently locked from future productivity. Through Event Horizon voter pools, however, all allocated voting power is, and will always be, fully productive. While the exact voters who turnout to each proposal are dynamic and always changing from proposal to proposal, the pool will always vote in every proposal. In this regard, voters may come and go, the voter body can change and evolve, experts in one subject may show up to a relevant proposal to their interest and not to others, and the pool continues to function while the ecosystem continues to benefit from highly-productive governance power. 2. Event Horizon is likely to succeed and in many ways already has. To start, we’re already live and currently support 7 DAOs. Our community of over 800 Citizens (500+ Voter Pass holders, 300+ delegators) have mobilized over $50m of governance authority across over 400 proposals. This is all with a small bootstrapped delegation sum of just over $1m. This grant would allow us to bring in many more delegators to help grow the pool, attract more sidelined voters to the DAO, and increase the total votable supply of OP. All Event Horizon infrastructure is currently live. New “governance incentive” contracts are being written as we speak. Therefore, our team of 4 have successfully been shipping since first going live over 9 months ago, and we will continue to do so! 3. The ultimate north star goal for Intent 1 is “increase the total votable supply of OP” which is one and the same as this Mission Request’s primary metric which Event Horizon successfully submitted with the help of Krzysztof from L2Beat a week back. Event Horizon will achieve this goal with a novel incentive mechanism: delegation incentives. In short, much of the OP granted will be used as incentives for community members to participate in and delegate to Event Horizon’s Public Access Voter Pools thereby increasing “the total votable supply of OP”. We anticipate this to be successful as this would be the only place where one can earn yield on their OP (putting low APR LPing aside). And the users get to hold onto their OP! And, once people delegate, they rarely undelegate. This is the primary concern around “redelegation” initiatives, but we’re using this stickiness to the benefit of the community: once delegated to the EH Public Access Voter Pools, these delegations are likely to stay even after incentives dry up. Furthermore, the Event Horizon pool votes 100% of the time thereby avoiding the redelegation problem of delegates dropping out of governance. Two birds with one stone. 4. Event Horizon is novel in many ways. First, no one is giving the all too often ignored retail community members a voice, and we do so without having to pay people to vote. The only incentive to show up is meaningful voting authority. Second, Event Horizon unifies all governance voting processes into a unified front end to make new voter onboarding as seamless as possible. Third, this grant would be one of the first examples of grant money being used not for liquidity mining incentives (whose liquidity ends up leaving once the incentives dry up), but for delegation aggregation which, importantly, all goes back to the community in a sticky, sustainable way to the benefit of the Optimism DAO. 5. Yes 6. Free 7. Any project on Optimism which has a governance token can also integrate with Event Horizon to benefit from our voter onboarding rails. Once the delegation incentive contract is live, other Optimism-based DAOs can not only benefit from Event Horizon as a voter onboarding platform (by having the DAO and the community delegate to EH) but also, with small grants from these DAOs, EH can also amass governance authority in these DAOs to onboard even more users. And any voter onboarded to Optimism can also vote and be onboarded to any other DAO we support on the network.

**Please briefly answer all market analysis questions**

Event Horizon doesn’t have any direct competitors. The closest we can find are protocols like PlutusDAO or Paladin Finance which are meta-governance aggregators but specifically for veTokens and efficient liquidity provision in DeFi. Event Horizon is a free protocol which helps make getting started with governance easy. We only touch DAO tokens, not veTokens. Event Horizon has over 500 Voter Passes minted to date, with over $50m of governance authority mobilized by retail voters. There’s not a clean comparable with these other protocols that do something entirely different.

**Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions**

This grant would allow us to give one of the few if only way of earning substantial yield on OP tokens all while having users maintain custody of their tokens. As these delegation incentives attract more delegations (in line with Intent 1 and this Mission Request’s north star), the amount of OP that retail users can mobilize for free goes up. The higher this gets, the more incentive there is for new users to begin to participate in Event Horizon and therefore Optimism governance. In short: grant->delegation incentives->EH Public Access Voter Pools grow->this attracts new users. Our target audience are lower capital crypto native users who have something to say but make the, frankly, rational choice to not vote given their small voting power. Event Horizon’s Implicit Delegation model gives retail users a solid start (typically in the 5 figure USD range) to cut their teeth in Optimism governance voting. Event Horizon users vote on our front end which kicks off on-chain voting on Optimism. Event Horizon pays all gas fees for the retail user. No real competitors on Optimism.

15,000 OP total. All the meta-governance infrastructure is already in place and functioning. The steps which remain are: 1) deploying the Voter Pass contract to Optimism (already live and functioning on mainnet), 2) writing and deploying the delegation incentive contract (where half the OP grant will sit to be paid out to delegators) 100% or 15k OP will be used for delegation incentives to grow the Event Horizon Public Access Voter Pool. Any user who delegates to Event Horizon (0xb35659cbac913D5E4119F2Af47fD490A45e2c826) will receive OP tokens on a pro-rata basis. The initial 40% (6k OP) will be used for delegation incentives distributed linearly and in proportion to the amount of OP delegated over 6 months to OP delegators to Event Horizon’s Public Access Voter Pool. After 1 year, the remaining 60% (9k OP) will be distributed to delegators from the prior 6 months in the same way as the initial 40%: in proportion to the amount of OP delegated weighted by duration delegated. A well known problem is the stickiness of delegations. When delegated to traditional delegates, this may be an issue as many delegates eventually stop participating in governance often due to voter fatigue. Event Horizon is unique in being able to help assist with this problem by partially turning this problem into a solution. First, Event Horizon automatically votes 100% of the time (as long as just 1 Event Horizon voter votes) so all OP delegated to Event Horizon will always be used in governance. Second, any OP delegated to Event Horizon’s Public Access Voter Pool is likely to stay: once tokens are delegated, they are rarely undelegated. This is traditionally a problem “redelegation” initiatives try to tackle, but given the 100% participation rate of Event Horizon means that this stickiness is actually a problem: these sticky delegations will now be voting 100% of the time. Finally, the OP emission schedule further incentivizes sticking around after the initial 6 months of incentive emissions given the post-unlock 12 month lump sum rewards people the based on how long they’ve delegated.

**Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions**

Event Horizon’s solution, paired with the funding from this grant help solve several problems chief of which is increasing the # of addresses delegating for the first time, the north star for both Intent 1 and this Mission Request that we submitted last week. Our solution also helps boost both token and voter participation rate given our novel governance mechanism Implicit Delegation. Event Horizon is a step towards solutions for a) increasing the umber of addresses delegating for the first time, b) increasing token participation, and c) increasing voter participation. We also help validate both the efficacy of the Optimism Grants operation as well as show that Optimism is a place where innovative new governance solutions are pioneered, given the new way in which our grant money will be distributed. Delegation incentives for new voter onboarding would be a first for not only Optimism, but for the broader crypto ecosystem. Event Horizon has a lot of latent potential for using novel governance mechanisms (Implicit Delegation, delegation incentives, and more on our blog) to the Optimism ecosystem. All these features can also be brought to any DAO on Optimism. As Event Horizon scales, this means new voters, new ideas, and more importantly, a more robust idea generation pipeline for the entire Optimism ecosystem. Event Horizon is committed to building on Optimism. Optimism governance is one of the most novel and robust DAO structures we’ve come across. It’s significance in the broader crypto and DeFi ecosystem further solidifies our interest in helping to support the Optimism ethos. Finally, and on a personal level, our interactions with Optimism delegates have reaffirmed our intuitions that the key players in the governance process are motivated by our same commitment to wanting to decentralize and democratize the digital world. Event Horizon is currently deployed on Ethereum mainnet. We will be deploying to Optimism post-grant.
