1. Brief description of the project and what it aims to achieve: Extra Finance is a leveraged yield strategy platform built on OP Mainnet. Extra Finance enables users to farm diverse farming pools with customized farming strategies. Extra Finance also functions as a lending protocol, users can deposit funds to earn lending interest. Extra Finance aims to help users implement optimized yield strategies flexibly, attracting more users and liquidity to bridge to Optimism. 2. Success potential: Proven High User Demand with Current TVL and User Base In the DeFi space, users consistently seek platforms to amplify and optimize their yield opportunities. Extra Finance offers capabilities such as leverage, a dynamic simulator, and one-click rebalancing tools to help users implement their yield strategies flexibly. Now, Extra Finance is deployed in the Superchain ecosystem with over $130 million in TVL, serving more than 60K DeFi users. Flexible Design & User-Friendly UX to Attract Broader Users Extra Finance streamlines the user experience by enabling one-click leverage (up to 7x) directly on the platform, eliminating the need to navigate external lending protocols. This enhances capital efficiency and adds a layer of convenience for users. Additionally, the inclusion of a PnL simulation chart, tailored for LST/LRT liquidity provision, allows users to accurately assess their yield rate and establish safety setups with clarity and precision. Team’s Solid Expertise The team has extensive experience in on-chain leverage, having built a secure DeFi protocol with over $400 million in TVL. With years of development and active participation in the space, we have a deep understanding of genuine user demand and holistic safety know-how. 3. Mission alignment: Extra Finance aims to enhance LST/LRT efficiency and increase yield-bearing assets on L2 with its core functions: leverage, data presentation, and real-time simulation. Users who bridge their assets to Optimism can use Extra Finance to flexibly implement leveraged or neutral yield strategies for optimized returns, keeping their assets within the Optimism ecosystem for a long period. ExtraFi has the technical resources to ensure rewards are given only to users that bridge in new assets. We've already integrated several bridges into ExtraFi, including LI.FI and deBridge . We can implement strict rules, ensuring that only users who bridge assets through ExtraFi's bridges and then deposit them into the lending pools will be eligible for rewards. 4. Novelty: Extra Finance simplifies the user experience by offering one-click leverage (up to 7x) directly on the platform, eliminating the need for external lending protocols. This improves capital efficiency and provides additional convenience for users. The platform also features flexible borrowing and a PnL simulation chart, enabling users to accurately evaluate their yield rates and set up safety measures with clarity and precision. We introduced an optimized interest model specifically tailored to enhance the effectiveness of LST/LRT liquidity provision. This tailored approach ensures that LST/LRT assets are well-suited to maximize returns.

**Please briefly answer all market analysis questions**

1. Competitors and differentiation Lending protocols: AAVE, Compound, Exactly Users can supply and borrow assets on pure lending protocols, but Extra Finance offers more with its leveraged yield farming. Here, users can borrow any assets they need from the lending pools to open leveraged positions. Additionally, Extra Finance functions as a lending protocol where users can deposit funds to earn passive income. The assets deposited on Extra Finance are exclusively borrowed by farmers for leverage farming within the platform. As a result, the APY of our lending pools is higher than most other lending protocols due to the high utilization of funds. Leveraged Farming: Alpaca Finance (not on Optimism) Yield Aggregator: Beefy (on Optimism, partially same) Compared with Beefy, the following are Extra Finance’s unique features: Provide up to 7x leverage Beefy provides auto-compounding service, while Extra Finance not only provides auto-compounding services, but also enables users to farm diverse pools with up to 7x leverage. Users can use whitelisted assets as collateral and leverage the returns. Stablecoin & LST Optimized leveraged yield farming By implementing a new interest rate model , Extra Finance serves as an innovative platform to optimize earnings by minimizing borrowing costs and reducing interest rate fluctuations. PnL Simulator Extra Finance provides a visualized chart with various factors such as price movement, IL, farming duration, etc, enabling users to make informed decisions when opening a position. With the yield farming simulator, users can see the estimated amount they will earn, how changes in price impact their equity value, and the liquidation price based on different position settings. Users can also simulate changes in value for varying leverage settings and borrowed assets. Support Farming with Long/Short or Neutral Viewpoint On Extra Finance, users have control over the exposure of a position. By borrowing different ratios of assets, he/she can hedge exposure or shape the portfolio according to their expectations, and minimize unexpected losses. And Extra Finance also supports one-click farming templates - to simplify the process of setting up farming strategies. These templates allow anyone to start farming like a DeFi expert in no time. Rigorous Farming Calculation APR is capped by emissions, and affected by lending interest, also, there is potential slippage and swap cost in LP zapping. All these are well calculated and listed in the 'Summary' before opening a position. Flexible Position Control Once users create a position on Extra Finance, they have the freedom to make adjustments anytime. They can control the exposure by ‘borrow more’ and ‘repay early’, and +/- leverage factors as needed. Extra Finance aims to be a professional yield strategy platform, other than a basic yield aggregator. 2. Current user base and estimation method Extra Finance currently has a user base of more than 60k, and the estimation method is by tracking through the Extra Finance dune dashboard.

**Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions**

1. Steps to increase user interaction As a protocol with substantial TVL in the Optimism ecosystem, ExtraFi has extensive experience in increasing user interaction. We will provide more lendable assets and lower borrowing interest for leverage users through incentive lending pools, enhance the efficiency of leveraged farming by taking the following steps: Provide incentives for wstETH, cbETH, frxETH, and paired ETH & USDC lending pools, along with other future whitelisted assets. Target a 5% reward APR incentive (in OP) on top of the native lending yield. Collaborate with LRT protocols to offer higher multiplier points for farming pools. Set up tasks on platforms like Galxe, such as bridging specified assets to Optimism and depositing them into ExtraFi’s lending pool. Spread the word to boost user participation and TVL. 2. Target audience characteristics With the grant, we intend to target specific users including: DeFi Experts & Enthusiasts :Experienced in DeFi and seeking optimized capital efficiency. ExtraFi offers specialized interfaces for position opening and management, helping them retain TVL within the ecosystem. Portfolio Optimizers : Users, including non-crypto natives, looking for tools to optimize their portfolios within Optimism. ExtraFi provides a service layer for optimal portfolio strategies. Yield Seekers : Users interested in earning steady yields. We incentivize these users to deposit into ExtraFi’s lending pools, attracting more liquidity to our protocol and Optimism ecosystem. 3. User interaction with Optimism Users interact with Optimism through ExtraFi in several key ways: Bridging More Assets to Optimism : We have integrated LI.FI and deBridge, allowing users to seamlessly bridge assets without leaving our dApp. Boosting Liquidity and Transaction Volume :Users of ExtraFi enhance liquidity (TVL) and transaction volume on Optimism by maintaining positions, farming, and earning yields within ExtraFi. Currently, ExtraFi holds over one-third of the liquidity in many integrated pools. Supporting Emerging Assets and Protocols : By integrating assets and protocols like RWA and LRT, ExtraFi helps these new assets accumulate initial user bases and TVL quickly, benefiting the entire Optimism ecosystem. 4. Competitors on Optimism: While ExtraFi does not have direct competitors within the Optimism ecosystem, there are a few protocols with somewhat similar offerings: Beefy Finance : Beefy provides auto-compounding yields, similar to ExtraFi’s yield optimization. However, ExtraFi distinguishes itself by offering leverage and advanced portfolio management tools, enhancing capital efficiency for users. Other Lending Protocols : While other lending protocols also provide passive incomes, ExtraFi stands out by using lent assets for leveraged farming. This allows users to engage in leveraged yield farming, making ExtraFi’s model more comprehensive and richer in features.

1. Size of request and justification 136,000 OP Proven Capability and Scale : ExtraFi is the largest leveraged farming protocol on Optimism (and Base). With the first batch of grants for Season 4, our TVL on OP peaked at $25M and has remained above $20M, significantly increasing the liquidity of the Optimism ecosystem. Detailed Token Utilization Plan : We will provide a comprehensive plan detailing the usage of tokens, timeline, and achievable milestones. Each component has been carefully calculated to ensure they are well-matched and realistic. 2. Plan for accomplishing the project (roadmap) Phase 1: Initial Setup (Weeks 1-4) Finalize integration of new assets (if needed) into ExtraFi. Launch the first batch of liquidity incentives, allocating 5,000 OP per week. Phase 2: Marketing and User Acquisition (Weeks 5-12) Continue liquidity incentives, maintaining a 5% rewarding APY. Roll out marketing campaigns in collaboration with platforms like Galxe, Tide Protocol, and Clique. Monitor and analyze user engagement and TVL growth. Phase 3: Sustained Growth (Weeks 13-26) Continue liquidity incentives, maintaining a 5% rewarding APY. Prioritize newly whitelisted assets for listing and corresponding lending incentives. Evaluate the impact of marketing campaigns, continue with the third batch of marketing campaigns, and adjust strategies as needed to ensure sustained user acquisition. 3. OP tokens distribution (percentages and initiatives) 95.6% for Liquidity Incentives - 130,000 OP Allocate 5,000 OP per week for 26 weeks for lending incentives for wstETH, cbETH, frxETH, and paired ETH or USDC lending pools. Target a 5% rewarding APY. Aim to increase the amount of assets on the lending side, ensure sufficient assets for the entire protocol. Newly whitelisted assets will be prioritized for listing on ExtraFi and matched with corresponding lending incentives. 4.4% for Marketing Campaign - 6,000 OP Allocate 500 OP per week for 12 weeks for marketing campaign Aim to inform users about the incentives, bridge assets to Optimism, and generate TVL. Educational quests, including step-by-step tasks like ‘Bridge at least 0.01 ETH to Optimism’, ‘Create a wstETH lending position on ExtraFi’, etc. Partnerships with platforms like Galxe, Tide Protocol, and Clique. The campaigns will be conducted in several phases, each lasting 4 weeks, to ensure sustainable acquisition of new users. 4. Token distribution timeline Weeks Token Distribution Phase 1 1-4 20,000 OP Phase 2 5-12 44,000 OP Phase 3 13-26 72,000 OP 5. Sustainability post-incentives Extra Finance, as the first leveraged yield farming protocol on Optimism, has shown to be a sustainable model benefiting both liquidity providers and lenders. Liquidity providers increase returns through effective farming, while lenders earn steady passive incomes. This flywheel effect has proven effective since launch, transitioning into a self-sustaining system once incentives are exhausted. From Season 4 data, our USDC lending pool’s TVL peaked at $4M during the incentive period and slightly decreased to $3.5M after incentives ended, maintaining stability with over 87% TVL retention. 6.
