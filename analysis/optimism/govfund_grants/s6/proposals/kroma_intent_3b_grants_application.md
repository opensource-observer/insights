**Defined Mandate:**

Bringing Mass Adoption to the Superchain with Kroket Kroma plans to launch Kroket, a Web3 reward app designed to drive mass adoption of the Superchain by seamlessly blending Web2 and Web3 experiences. What is a Reward App? A reward app encourages users to complete specific actions with incentives such as earning points, coupons, cash, or digital assets. Users engage in tasks like watching ads, purchasing products, participating in surveys, or consuming content. These apps are highly effective at driving frequent user engagement. Since 2020, reward apps have thrived in markets like Korea and Japan. The Korean reward app market is valued at $15 billion, with apps like CashSlide (10 million downloads, 7.5 million MAU) and Mistplay (2 million MAU) leading the space. In Japan, the market is worth $20 billion, with standout apps like Torima (16 million downloads) and Moppy (12 million downloads) driving engagement through daily activities. How Kroket Works Kroket will make Web2 users flow into the Web3 space, allowing them to experience Web3 step by step. Users can complete tasks ranging from simple Web2 activities—such as answering quizzes or watching ads—to Web3 activities like engaging with dApps on Kroma. In return, they earn rewards such as points, gift cards, or crypto tokens and NFTs. Kroma ID will serve as the account abstraction tool for Kroket, acting as the key to onboarding Web2 users. While Web3 has made significant technological advancements, it still presents many inconveniences and requires a steep learning curve for general Web2 users. With Kroma ID, Web2 users will not even realize they are interacting with Web3, ensuring a smooth and gradual transition to Web3. dApps on Kroket will have the opportunity to onboard users not just from the relatively small current Web3 space, but from the entire Web2 ecosystem via Kroket. Kroket Phases Kroket will be introduced through different phases: Phase 1 (2024 November): Introduce Web2 tasks and rewards, seamlessly onboarding Web2 users by creating wallets using account abstraction, without their awareness. Phase 2: Introduce a blend of Web2 and Web3 tasks and rewards, gradually guiding users towards dApps and Web3 token rewards. Phase 3: Educate users about the values of Web3—such as immutability and trustlessness—encouraging them to explore the broader Web3 ecosystem beyond Kroket. Kroma Flywheel: Kroma L2 - Kroma ID - Kroket Sample UX of Kroket The Kroma Superchain Grant Program The Kroma Superchain Grant Program is dedicated to supporting dApps onboarding to Kroket , a reward app designed to convert Web2 users into Web3 participants. These dApps will be highlighted within the app, encouraging Web2 users to engage with them through OP token incentivization. Further details about Kroket are outlined in the Defined Mandate section. Kroma Grants Council is seeking dApps for Kroket that are easy for Web2 users to understand and offer intuitive guidance. These dApps should integrate Kroma ID to ensure a seamless user experience and support account abstraction features such as Session Key and Social Recovery. Mobile-friendly applications will be prioritized to provide a smooth transition for users moving from Kroket to the dApp. dApps targeting the Korean or Japanese markets are also preferred. Some examples include: Gaming Games that utilize on-chain gacha mechanics, allowing users to verify the randomness of outcomes. Games that give users true ownership of their digital assets. Lifestyle Social-fi projects that bridge Web2 users into the Web3 space (You can imagine services such as Interface, Zora, or Perma). Secondary markets for RWAs, enabling users to trade items like shopping points or tickets. DeFi A dApp that facilitates cost-averaging investments in Bitcoin or ETH—assets that many Web2 users may have heard of but never invested in. A perpetual DEX with a visualization feature, such as a tug-of-war showing long vs. short positions, making it easier for users to grasp the trading dynamics. Kroma will actively promote the services that receive grants through the Kroma Superchain Grant Program, ensuring these projects contribute to the overall Superchain ecosystem.

**Intent #3B Alignment:**

Kroket will serve as a gateway for Web2 users in Asia to experience Superchain. The reward app model has already been well-proven in the Korean and Japanese markets. Kroma’s developer, Lightscale, is a Korea-based team led by founders with a strong track record of successfully launching multiple Web2 mobile apps in the region. By attracting a large number of Web2 users through Kroket and gradually introducing them to Web3, Kroma will contribute to achieving the holy grail of Web3 mass adoption. In the future, Kroket will expand its support for the entire Superchain, providing Web2 users a seamless entry point into even more Web3 experiences.

**OP Chain Contribution:**

Kroma ranks 3rd in Txs and 7th in TVL, according to the Superchain Health Dashboard. To further raise awareness of the Superchain, Kroma is actively collaborating with other Superchains. For instance, Kroma co-organized the Supergame campaign with GameSwift and hosted Superchain events in Asia, such as at EDCON, KBW, and other prominent blockchain conferences. These efforts aim to increase Superchain visibility and adoption, especially in the Asia region. In addition, Kroma is contributing to the development of the OP Stack. Kroma has applied for Retro Funding Round 5 with 2 key projects: Native Account Abstraction on OP Stack Permissionless ZK Fault Proof system

**Grants Allocation Framework:**

The grant allocation framework will be modular, allowing for continuous improvement and adjustment based on market trends and Kroket’s objective to act as a funnel for bringing more users into Web3. The framework is designed to make the process efficient and transparent, ensuring that applicants understand their status and what is needed to progress. Tiered Grant System To ensure efficient allocation, Kroma will introduce a tiered grant system. Early-stage projects with no viable product will receive smaller grants, while projects with proven metrics and operational products will qualify for larger grants, based on their immediate contribution to Kroma and the Superchain ecosystem. Each grantee will be assigned an account manager from the Grants Council, who will relay the results of the internal assessment, negotiate milestones, and deliverables, and finalize the grant agreement. Grantees can opt to add additional milestones to qualify for higher-tier grants or proceed with the proposed grant amount based on the initial evaluation. Criteria for Grant Eligibility Projects with a proven or convincing blockchain model are eligible for grants, with the following exclusions: Projects related to pornography, gambling, drugs, violence, or other unethical content. Grantees pivoting to such verticals after receiving a grant will have their agreements terminated. Applications will be reviewed by the Decision Makers within one week, based on the following criteria: Contribution to Kroket or user experience enhancement. Authenticity of the business model and necessity of blockchain technology. Expected on-chain performance Target Metrics illustrated below.

**Target Metrics:**

Kroma will mainly use the metrics below, among the Optimism Grants Council’s sound metrics. Growth Number of active addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts The total amount of gas fees generated from grantee’s contracts Stickiness Percentage of retained active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts DAA/MAA ratio

**Milestones:**

Grant distribution will be based on 4 milestones. These milestones can be completed within a single period or spread across multiple periods, depending on the grantee’s progress. All milestones may be achieved within one period if conditions allow. For grantees not yet integrated with Kroma, the first milestone will be Kroma Mainnet integration. Each milestone will be evaluated based on the number of active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts and the retention rate of these active addresses. Example milestones: Milestone 1: Deploy on Kroma Mainnet. Milestone 2: Achieve 1,000 monthly active addresses for two consecutive months. Milestone 3: Achieve 5,000 monthly active addresses for two consecutive months and 30% of retained active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts. Milestone 4: Achieve 10,000 monthly active addresses for two consecutive months and 30% of retained active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts. The specific targets for each milestone and the corresponding grant amounts will be determined by the Decision Makers after a thorough review.

**Impact Analysis:**

To ensure transparency and track the progress of each grantee, Kroma will maintain and regularly update a Google spreadsheet shared with the Optimism Collective. This spreadsheet will include details on all grantees, their key metrics, and milestone achievements.


Additionally, Kroma will provide retrospective reports on a regular basis, summarizing overall progress, challenges, and any necessary adjustments to the program. These reports will include insights into the retention of active users, dApp adoption rates, and the impact of the grants on the broader Superchain ecosystem. 

**Token Delivery:**

Kroma will sign a grant agreement with each grantee, including all the conditions and the method of distribution. The agreement will include:
- Milestones
   - Conditions for each milestone
   - Grant size allocated for each milestone
- Grant Payment details
   - The grantee’s wallet address on OP Mainnet
   - The distribution timeline and method
- Collective Grant Policies
