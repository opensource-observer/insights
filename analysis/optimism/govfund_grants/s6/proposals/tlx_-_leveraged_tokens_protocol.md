TLX is a leveraged tokens protocol that enables users to mint and redeem leveraged tokens for over 70 assets with up to 20x leverage. Built on the Optimism Superchain and powered by the Synthetix liquidity layer, TLX brings next-generation leveraged tokens on-chain. TLX is Optimism native, with plans to expand to the Optimism Superchain. Through this expansion, TLX will provide the most expansive leveraged token trading platform with diverse asset offerings and hundreds of different leveraged tokens for users to trade. TLX will be the first protocol to bring scalable and efficient leveraged tokens on-chain providing a trading experience akin to centralized exchanges. In the current state of DeFi there is minimal support for leveraged tokens. While there has been demand for leveraged tokens in the past, as demonstrated by Index Coop's ETH2X-FLI, which reached a market capitalization of $230 million in 2021, this demand has not been met by sufficient supply (i.e., application support for leveraged tokens). The Index Coop product had several issues when it came to rebalances which ultimately led to its decline (also compounded by Ethereum mainnet's high gas fees). To this date, the current landscape for leveraged tokens in DeFi can be summarized by: - Limited asset support (just ETH and BTC) - Limited leverage support (only support for 2x or 3x leverage) - Poor mechanism design TLX will succeed because it brings all the missing factors that have limited the growth of leveraged tokens in DeFi. Furthermore, leveraged tokens offer traders a unique benefit due to their non-liquidating design. This is especially great for new traders who, through TLX, can trade with leverage without the fear of getting liquidated. TLX is OP mainnet-native and fully aligned with the Targeted extension of Superfest mission request. The request states that existing DeFi projects must have “a credible plan that would specifically encourage more DeFi builders to come to Superchain." TLX enables DeFi builders to build new DeFi primitives thanks to its composable and permissionless design. Specifically, TLX leveraged tokens enable users to easily build DeFi products for delta-neutral yield farming or what is commonly referred to as the cash/carry trade. This is explained in more detail in later sections of this grant application. The TLX protocol introduced a new DeFi primitive: Composable perps. This is a new innovation for DeFi as before TLX it was not possible to use perp positions across DeFi as you would with normal ERC-20 tokens. TLX, being the first protocol to launch perpetual futures-backed leveraged tokens on chain, made this possible. TLX leveraged tokens are held as composable ERC-20 tokens. Each leveraged token is a tokenization of an underlying Synthetix perpetual futures contract and therefore realizes its underlying behavior. For example, by holding ETH2L (a TLX 2x ETH long leveraged token) a user is holding a tokenized representation of a Synthetix 2x long ETH perpetual futures contract. This is a powerful DeFi primitive because, unlike normal perpetual futures protocols, TLX leveraged tokens make it possible to use leveraged tokens across all of DeFi. A few examples of this are transferring long or short positions between wallets, providing liquidity, farming funding rates, and the list goes on! Yes, TLX is open-source TLX is fee-based for end users and has a fee structure comparable to competitors. The fees the TLX protocol charges are as follows: [Streaming fee: 2.0%] The streaming fee is an annualized fee that is charged on the notional amount of a leveraged token position. It is charged directly to the position whenever a rebalancing event occurs. [Redemption fee: 0.3%] The redemption fee is charged on the amount of sUSD redeemed multiplied by the target leverage of the position. Yes, TLX leveraged tokens are composable with other projects on Optimism. Each leveraged token is an ERC-20 token and can be used on any Optimism-based protocol that supports ERC-20 tokens. Other projects on Optimism have already started utilizing the composability of TLX. For example, Velodrome currently supports a wstETH/ETH1S (ETH1S is a TLX ETH 1x short leveraged token) liquidity pool. The pool currently has $46k in TVL and enables users to farm delta-neutral yields simply by providing liquidity! Whereby, through providing liquidity in the wstETH/ETH1S Velodrome pool users earn staking yields from wstETH, funding rates from ETH1S, and all while staying delta-neutral. This delta-neutral yield farming strategy that TLX enables creates new possibilities for a decentralized cash/carry trade. Unlike the now popularized cash/carry trade that Ethena (USDe) developed, TLX powers a cash/carry trade that is permissionless, has no counterparty risk, and can theoretically be supported for any asset.

**Please briefly answer all market analysis questions**

TLX currently has two competitors, IndexCoop and Toros. Between these competitors, TLX differentiates itself by the following: IndexCoop: Total leveraged tokens: 6 Support assets: 2 Supported leverage factors: 1x-3x Supported chains: Ethereum Toros: Total leveraged tokens: 24 Supported assets: BTC, ETH, SOL, MATIC Supported leverage factors: 1x-4x Supported chains: Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon TLX: Total leveraged tokens: 70 Supported assets: BTC, ETH, SOL, PEPE, LINK, DOGE, OP, SUI, SEI, ETH/BTC Supported leverage factors: 1x-7x Supported chains: Optimism As demonstrated by these metrics, TLX clearly differentiates itself by providing nearly triple the amount of leveraged tokens (as well as higher leverage factors) than that of the nearest competitor. Furthermore, TLX leveraged tokens are different in the fact that they are all backed by Synthetix perps. This enables TLX to theoretically support leveraged tokens for any asset. On the contrary, the majority of leveraged tokens offered by competitors are not backed by perps markets and rather utilize money markets (e.g. Aave). The TLX user base can be described by the following. All stats/estimations are pulled directly on-chain and can be viewed in further detail here : Total trades: 70,710 Avg trades per day: 477 Total unique users: 3,650 Total notional volume: $440,670,000 Total value locked: $1,40,000

**Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions**

Receiving this grant will help to increase user interaction on TLX via the following steps: OP rewards will be distributed to users who buy, hold, and sell leveraged tokens. Specifically, the distribution of OP rewards is proportional to the amount of volume plus the share of open interest each user has on TLX (calculated via total streaming fees + redemption fees paid). A positive flywheel for user retention: The more users interact with the TLX protocol (by trading leveraged tokens) the more OP rewards they will receive. Total user growth: The OP rewards received from this grant will impact TLX leveraged tokens by attracting new users. By rewarding users who try TLX by trading leveraged tokens, new users will be incentivized to use the protocol. The TLX target audience has the following core characteristics: Mobile first users. Leveraged tokens offer a UX better fitting for mobile users than traditional perpetual futures. By requiring drastically less management than perps, and maintaining constant leverage, leveraged tokens can introduce new users that perps cannot. Notice traders: Leveraged tokens are a naturally more fitting product for users new to trading with leverage. Experienced traders: Leveraged tokens offer constant leverage which is a tool that experienced traders can use for unique strategies Passive traders: Leveraged tokens are non-liquidating by design and automatically maintain their target leverage factor. This makes them a great tool for users who cannot trade actively or prefer to trade passively. Meme coin traders: TLX supports the first ever on-chain leveraged meme coins. The constant leverage provided by TLX leveraged meme coins makes them an attractive product for all users who trade meme coins. The TLX protocol, which was deployed on OP mainnet on May 16th, 2024, is Optimism native. TLX leveraged tokens are not available on any other chains other than Optimism. Meaning, in order to use TLX leveraged tokens users must bridge to OP mainnet. While TLX currently offers leveraged tokens that are not available anywhere else, the OP grant received will help to attract new users from other ecosystems and thus increase user interaction with Optimism. TLX currently has one competitor on Optimism, Toros. While Toros does offer leveraged tokens, TLX leveraged tokens offer a unique value proposition in comparison. The majority of Toros leveraged tokens utilize money markets. Meaning, for users who want to farm funding rates they have not utility (unlike TLX leveraged tokens which enable this). Furthermore, TLX and Toros both provide a different range of supported assets and leverage factors. As both protocols serve a unique purpose, the OP grant received will have minimal impact on Optimism native competitors and rather only be impactful towards protocols that are not on Optimism.

TLX is a first-of-its-kind leveraged tokens protocol that has had impressive growth since its initial launch. As an Optimism native protocol, TLX offers Optimism with the opportunity to be the go-to chain for leveraged tokens. Leveraged tokens, as a financial instrument, make up a significant share of global derivatives markets. With the clear opportunity to make Optimism the home of this class of derivatives (leveraged tokens), the grant request of 75,000 OP is justified. Plan for accomplishing the project: Receive grant on L2 recipient address Within 2 weeks of receiving the grant, commence our OP incentives program by promoting on various social media platforms and the TLX front-end. Distribute OP rewards to qualifying users on a weekly basis (every Friday) OP tokens will be distributed in proportion to the total amount of fees that each user generates on TLX by trading leveraged tokens. These fees are a function of each user's share of total volume and open interest. Each week, 20% of the total OP grant received will be distributed to users. Tokens will be distributed over the course of 5 weeks from the inception of our OP incentives program. There will be 5 distributions in total, each occurring on Friday. TLX is not dependent on incentives. Since launch, TLX has done over $440m in notional trading volume while averaging hundreds 200+ trades per day. All of this activity has been without incentives. From launch until now there have been zero incentives provided to users for trading TLX leveraged tokens. All user activity has been driven by the product itself. With that said, sustainability post-incentives is a non-issue for TLX as sustainable user activity has already been achieved without any incentives. The OP rewards program can be viewed as a way to grow our user base by attracting new users while further strengthening brand loyalty for our existing users. The OP tokens will be held in our L2 recipient address and distributed to eligible users on a weekly basis. The distribution of these tokens to eligible users can be verified easily on-chain or via https://tlxstats.com/index.php by comparing that week's trading activity on TLX with the addresses that received OP rewards (and the number of OP tokens each address received).

**Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions**

There are other chains that provide support for leveraged tokens. What can often define the success of a chain is its ability to dominate a specific niche. This can be demonstrated by the success of Solana which was driven by their ability to dominate the meme coin niche. By dominating a niche in the market, a chain strengthens its value proposition to participants. TLX is the first leveraged token protocol. All other protocols that offer leveraged tokens have them as a side feature (e.g. they are a yield aggregator that also offers leveraged tokens). As the first leveraged token protocol, it is the ambition of TLX to dominate that niche and thus solidify Optimism as the home of leveraged tokens. By enabling Optimism to dominate the niche of leveraged tokens, TLX helps to solve problems for Optimism such as differentiating itself between different chains and market capture. Furthermore, TLX enables new DeFi primitives to be built, such as delta-neutral LP tokens, thanks to its Synthetix perps backed design While TLX offers Optimism with the opportunity to dominate the niche of on-chain leveraged tokens, it also enables it to attract a new class of DeFi builders. Specifically, builders for delta neutral yield farming products. This is made possible because TLX leveraged tokens, which are composable ERC20 tokens, put funding rates on-chain. By holding TLX leveraged tokens users are able to farm funding rates in a way that is completely composable and permissionless. Furthermore, TLX leveraged tokens can easily be paired with their spot counterpart to create delta-neutral liquidity pools. The viability of this concept can be seen in production via the wstETH/ETH1S Velodrome pool (ETH1S is a TLX 1x short ETH leveraged token). The pool enables users to earn delta-neutral yields from ETH staking and funding rates simply by holding LP tokens. The pool currently has $463k in TVL and has at times reached close to $1 million TVL. We believe this unique DeFi primitive of delta-neutral LP tokens, will encourage others to build on the Superchain and we have already seen user demand for it. Furthermore, several builders have expressed interest in building a protocol on top of TLX that has the sole purpose of enabling users to farm yields with TLX delta-neutral LP tokens. At the time of this writing, there is currently $37.2 billion in open interest across centralized crypto exchanges. Just like perp DEXs, the grander ambition of TLX is to take this open interest off CEXs and bring it on-chain. Furthermore, there is a very clear demand for leveraged tokens as demonstrated by traditional markets (in the form of leveraged ETFs) and by the growth metrics shown by TLX. With these points in mind, while also considering TLX’s competitive advantage of being the first leveraged tokens protocol, TLX offers significant growth potential for Optimism. By a fair estimate, TLX leveraged tokens have the potential to bring thousands of new traders to Optimism and trading volume by the hundreds of millions. Where there are users, there are builders. With these aforementioned points in mind, we believe that TLX also offers Optimism growth potential by encouraging new builders to build on the superchain. This is primarily due to the fact that TLX is in line with the traditional DeFi Ethos of being composable and permissionless. Protocols that enable users to earn yield from the cash/carry trade (e.g. Ethena) have shown to be a billion-dollar market. However, all of these protocols are permissioned and do not encourage building in the way a permissionless protocol would. The TLX protocol is the first to enable a permissionless cash/carry or what some users have called "a fully on-chain and permissionless Ethena." We believe that this offers Optimism with tremendous potential for building new products and a unique edge for encouraging new builders in comparison with other chains. Make Optimism the home of permissionless delta-neutral yields! TLX is Optimism native. We are committed to building on Optimism and in the future we plan to expand TLX to the Superchain. Exclusively on Optimism
