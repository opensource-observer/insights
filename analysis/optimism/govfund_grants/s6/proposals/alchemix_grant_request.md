**Please briefly answer all project details questions**

Brief description of the project and what it aims to achieve: Alchemix allows users to take a like-kind loan off of stablecoin and ETH collateral deployed in DeFi yield strategies. Because the loan is like-kind, and because the yield earned is used to repay the loan, the user experiences a non-liquidatable self-repaying loan. The set-and-forget nature of Alchemix loans creates long-term TVL and enables users to spend their loans off-chain for real-world use cases. Actual examples include buying a boat, wedding ring, timber mill, house down payments, and more! Key point: Alchemix is set-and-forget, which makes TVL sticky . 2. Success potential: Alchemix would use the grant for the wsTETH vault, which is a familiar, proven asset. Additionally, Alchemix has an ongoing OP grant nearing the tail end of its distribution (<60 days left) where the TVL results in the OP providing 5.5% increased APR, thus proving that Alchemix can sustain new TVL at a cost in-line with the target of 5%. The existing grant distribution also proves that the infrastructure is already in place to utilize this grant from day 1. The TVL chart (visible on https://alchemix-stats.com/) has a large spike when the OP grant started, showing TVL can grow quickly once the incentives are available. At current prices, 50k OP distributed over 6 months should result in a TVL increase of ~$3m in Alchemix wstETH vaults, which represents a TVL increase of less than double the existing TVL. Key points: Infrastructure is already live and functional to distribute the grant. Current incentives are already in-line with the 5% APR target. 3. Mission alignment: The “Optimism Dominance in Yield-Bearing Assets (3 of 4)” mission request highlights the desire to make Optimism the dominant place for yield-bearing assets. More specifically, through the mission, protocols are encouraged to incentivize users to bridge yield-bearing assets such as RWAs, DeFi tokens, and staked ETH onto Optimism and into whitelisted DeFi protocols. With this application Alchemix would become part of the whitelisted protocols list to encourage users to move staked ETH (in the form of wstETH) to Optimism. One of Alchemix’s most successful products has been alETH, with 14,780 ETH staked across all vaults at the time the application. Due to the nature of the self-repaying loan product, where users deposit their yield-bearing assets into Alchemix and take out a like-kind loan in the form of alETH with little-to-no position management necessary, TVL in the vaults is sticky. Unless users repay their loans, or paid until the loans are paid off, the collateral assets remain in place. With the OP grant as part of this mission, Alchemix will be able to attract new TVL in the form of wstETH to Optimism that will be sticky. As such, the OP grant should not just lead to a temporary boost in TVL for Alchemix on Optimism, but will instead be of a more permanent nature. This behavior is further supported by the Aribtrum deployment sustaining TVL since incentives ended in mid-september, despite Alchemix on Arbitrum having less vaults and less TVL than the Alchemix on Optimism deployment. Key point: Alchemix TVL remains even when incentives end. 4. Novelty: Alchemix invented the self-repaying loan concept back in 2021 and has held a unique position in the market since that point as the main venue where users can deposit yield-bearing tokens, take out a loan, and not worry about liquidation. Alchemix creates a way for users to access capital efficiency, at a lower risk-reward level than other lending models due to a focus on like-kind lending, lack of variable interest, and lack of liquidations. 5. Will the project be open source? Yes, the Alchemix contracts and front-end are open source. 6. Free or fee-based for end users? Users of Alchemix do not have to pay any fees to use the platform. However, the Alchemix DAO does take a 10% cut on the yield of all yield-bearing assets. So for example, if asset X has a yield of 3% p.a., then the end user’s loan will be repaid at a rate of 2.7% p.a. 7. Is it composable with other projects on Optimism? How? Alchemix has been live on Optimism for >2 years and has integrated a variety of yield-bearing assets onto the platform. Alchemix is also Optimism-aligned with all alAsset liquidity incentivized on Velodrome, with Alchemix acting as an active veVELO voter and locker.

**Please briefly answer all market analysis questions**

Competitors and differentiation Alchemix exists in a unique space in lending where the lenders (alETH holders) have to be more active, while the borrowers (self-repaying loan users) can set-and-forget. This is a more difficult economic model to get to work, but Alchemix is uniquely experienced in building/operating in this design space. Alchemix’s primary competition is simply improving the model, as no Alchemix forks have been successful to date (none are currently still in operation with significant TVL). Alchemix is not a competitor to traditional lending as it offers a product that is complementary - offering more ways for users to express market beliefs and maximize capital efficiency. Key point : Alchemix offers ways for users to position their capital that differs from traditional lending models - thus it is additive, not competitive. 2. Current user base and estimation method At the time of application, Alchemix has a total of 9,577 users that have an active position on the platform on Optimism. This number includes all users that have deposited yield-bearing assets into an Alchemix vault. For alETH specifically there are a total of 5,442 unique depositors.

**Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions**

Steps to increase user interaction: Alchemix will make announcements to the community, join partner twitter spaces, and run quest events as necessary to ensure TVL is consistently increasing up to the goal amount. Alchemix can also provide additional incentives from the treasury if needed to attract TVL. Alchemix will also continue to support alAsset liquidity so that users are able to sell their borrowed alAssets to access the benefit of self repaying loans. 2. Target audience characteristics: The primary target audience is existing users who have TVL on Mainnet that wish to migrate to a lower gas environment. The secondary audience is users who may have started their crypto journey on L2s and not yet be familiar with Alchemix. 3. User interaction with Optimism Users would be expected to bridge funds to Optimism, utilize Alchemix to deposit to yield strategies and take a loan, and use Velodrome to swap their loan to the asset of their choice. These actions will also create arbitrage opportunities that will drive more volume to the velodrome pools. 4. Competitors on Optimism No direct competitors are known. All other lending protocols either focus on non-like kind lending, or operate as like-kind leveraged yield farm lending with variable interest rates (thus cater more towards degens that are able to manage their positions)

**Select the metric specified in the mission request**

(Intent 3 Growth) TVL in grantee’s protocol

**Fill out your metric objective**

Increase in TVL of 1320 ETH in the wstETH vault (~50%), depending on OP/ETH price fluctuation. 

**Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions**

Size of request and justification The request would approximately grow the TVL of Alchemix on Optimism by 1320 ETH (assuming OP/ETH price of 0.00065 and target APR of 5%), which is achievable as demonstrated by the current (soon to end) OP boost currently offering a 5-6% APR boost. 2. Plan for accomplishing the project (roadmap) Development work is already done. OP would be sent to the collector and set to melt and distribute over 6 months. The majority of the work would be on the marketing and BD side, in which Alchemix would utilize twitter/discord announcements, external partner podcasts/twitter spaces, advertising with existing partners, and providing additional incentives from the treasury as needed. Alchemix will increase deposit caps to allow room for the anticipated TVL increase. 3. OP tokens distribution (percentages and initiatives) 100% of the OP would go to speeding up loan repayment for depositors in the Alchemix wstETH vault on Optimism. 4. Token distribution timeline Tokens would be distributed over 6 months. 5. Sustainability post-incentives Alchemix has provable sticky TVL due to the set-and-forget nature of the protocol. 6. Additional accountability info (smart contract addresses, wallet addresses, etc.): Addresses that will come in contact with the OP are listed above.

**Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions**

Problem solved for Optimism Alchemix can continue to bring additional TVL to Optimism, which is likely to be sticky. Additionally, Alchemix is unique in that it provides a low-risk, low-touch product, thus making it a good candidate to bring new users onchain, which is a key goal of Optimism. 2. Value proposition Alchemix creates new on-chain opportunities that are easy to show new users, at a provably low cost (measured in APR paid) 3. Growth potential for Optimism Alchemix can bring experienced DeFi capital from other chains, and is uniquely positioned as an easy-to-use protocol that can be shown to new on-chain users. 4. Commitment to building on Optimism Optimism is currently Alchemix’s largest L2 deployment in terms of TVL and offerings, Arbitrum being the only other deployment. Alchemix is a proven VELO locker and voter. Alchemix has no plans to deploy on any additional L2s and is committed to maintaining and growing offerings on Optimism, including looking ahead to Alchemix v3. 5. Deployment status Currently self-repaying loans are available on Mainnet, Optimism, and Arbitrum.
