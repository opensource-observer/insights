**Defined Process:**

Overview The OP Grant requested will be used to incentivize developer growth and user engagement within the Mint Blockchain ecosystem. The goal is to drive NFT innovation and adoption of NFTs  across Mint and the broader Superchain ecosystem. Builder Grants Allocation Process Target Audience : Developer teams, both new and existing, that have contributed to the Mint Blockchain ecosystem since its mainnet launch (May 15th, 2024). Teams that bring innovative NFT applications, attract real users, and generate on-chain activity will be eligible for the grant. Application Process: The process will consist of three main stages: application, review, and approval. Applications will be accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis. After receiving the grant, Mint Blockchain will establish a dedicated page to guide developers through the grant process, including criteria and application forms. Mint will conduct periodic reviews and announce grant recipients on a quarterly basis to allow sufficient time for development. Metrics: The focus will be on objective metrics, such as the number of on-chain users and transaction volume that a project contributes. As a blockchain specializing in NFTs, we also encourage dApps that cater to diverse use cases. Therefore, innovation and forward-thinking ideas will also be factored in as subjective evaluation criteria. User Incentive Grants Target Audience: Teams that have already deployed dApps on Mint’s mainnet, as well as those new to the ecosystem, can apply for this grant. Application Process: Similar to the Builder Grants, this process will follow the same stages of application, review, and approval. However, applicants must submit a detailed plan on how they will use the OP tokens to incentivize users and the expected outcomes. The goal is to maximize the grant’s effectiveness in driving user engagement. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis, with the review period in sync with or more flexible than the Builder Grants. Metrics: This grant will focus on measurable, real on-chain activity, with a particular emphasis on the authenticity of users and transactions as key criteria. Notes : Mint Blockchain will continuously adjust the grant allocation timeline based on best practices and welcomes feedback from the Grants Council to optimize the process.

**Intent #3B Alignment:**

Mint Blockchain's grants program is designed to align with Intent #3B by driving growth in NFT-related applications within the Superchain. Our goal is to establish Mint as the premier hub for NFT protocols and use cases, encouraging developers to launch innovative projects that bring real-world utility to NFT assets. By fostering this ecosystem, we aim to increase transaction volume, user engagement, and overall gas consumption, contributing to the broader Superchain economy. Through this program, we seek to make Mint Blockchain the leading chain for NFTs, attracting developers, creators, and Web3 users alike. By incentivizing both emerging and existing projects, we will help expand the Superchain’s reach, offering new ways to onboard users from Web2 and build applications that enhance the onchain economy. This approach will not only grow Mint's ecosystem but also strengthen the entire Superchain through increased activity and cross-chain integration.

**OP Chain Contribution:**

Mint Blockchain is proud to be a fast-growing, innovative ecosystem that contributes significantly to the Superchain Collective. Since our mainnet launch, we have made substantial strides in growing our ecosystem, driving developer adoption, and promoting Superchain awareness, particularly in the Asian market. Below, we outline how Mint’s ecosystem growth, innovative dapps, regional exposure, and GTM efforts contribute to the Superchain’s success and align with its goals. 1. Fast Growing Ecosystem Since launching its developer mainnet on May 15 and public mainnet on July 1, Mint Blockchain has demonstrated significant growth, as highlighted in the Superchain Health Dashboard . As of September, Mint Blockchain ranks second in daily transactions (124.8K txs/day) within the Superchain,(after exclusion of  OP Mainnet and Base). Its estimated contribution to Collective Revenue stands at 7.61 ETH, accounting for 2% of the Superchain’s total revenue. Excluding contributions from OP Mainnet and Base, Mint's share rises to an impressive 72.8%, reflecting its pivotal role within the ecosystem. 2. Dapps Mint Blockchain's ecosystem has rapidly developed, with a solid foundation of infrastructure tools and protocols in place. According to the Mint Ecosystem page , there are currently over 80 decentralized applications (dapps) live, spanning across innovative areas such as NFT+DeFi, NFT+Meme, and NFT+Social products. The ecosystem is poised to grow further, with more groundbreaking dapps set to launch on Mint blockchain and expand across the broader Superchain, contributing to its diversity and innovation. 3. Superchain Exposure in Asia As a team primarily based in Asia, Mint Blockchain has played a key role in increasing the Superchain's visibility among developers and communities in the region. Over the past two months, Mint partnered with Kroma to host the "Superchain Pioneers in Asia" events in Tokyo, Japan , and Seoul, South Korea . These events attracted a large number of developers and community members, enhancing their understanding of the Superchain. Mint is committed to hosting similar initiatives in the future to further drive Superchain awareness in Asia. 4. GTM Mint Blockchain is also actively supporting the Superchain through various go-to-market (GTM) strategies. Most recently, Mint contributed to The SUNNYs , a celebration of Superchain growth and innovation, in collaboration with the Optimism Foundation. Mint remains dedicated to participating in more marketing and GTM activities that promote Superchain's expansion globally.

**Grants Allocation Framework:**

Mint Blockchain offers a structured and transparent framework for allocating grants to projects within its ecosystem. The process is divided into two main programs: the Builder Grant and the User Incentive Grant, each with a budget of 500K OP. The objective of these programs is to support projects that drive innovation, increase user adoption, and enhance the overall health of the ecosystem. Below is a summary of the criteria and process for both grant types, ensuring an equitable and impactful allocation. Builder Grant (500K OP) The Builder Grant is designed to support innovative dapps and infrastructure projects that contribute to the long-term sustainability of the Mint Blockchain ecosystem. Key evaluation criteria include: Impact: We assess how the project will contribute to the ecosystem in terms of transaction growth, user onboarding, and retention. Priority is given to projects expected to significantly scale within Mint and the broader Superchain. Deployment Timeline: We also consider how quickly and effectively the team can deploy their solution, with a preference for projects ready to launch within 1-3 months. Team’s Track Record: Preference is given to teams with proven experience in developing on Ethereum or L2 ecosystems especially on Mint Blockchain. This includes evaluating their past achievements and the technical complexity of their projects. Innovation and Alignment: Projects must demonstrate innovative approaches, ideally offering solutions not currently addressed in the ecosystem. Preference is given to those that align with Mint’s mission of advancing Web3 adoption through NFTs. User Incentive Grant (500K OP) The User Incentive Grant is focused on incentivizing user growth and engagement across the Mint Blockchain ecosystem. Key evaluation factors include: User Onboarding and Retention: Projects must present strategies for acquiring new users and retaining them over time. Grants will be awarded based on their ability to bring in a significant number of users or enhance user experiences within the ecosystem. Transaction Volume: A critical metric is the number of transactions the project is expected to generate, as this reflects user activity and ecosystem growth. Sustainability of Incentives: The long-term sustainability of the user incentive models is also a priority. Projects that demonstrate a clear plan for maintaining user activity beyond initial grant allocation will be prioritized. Both grant programs involve an objective review process, with final decisions based on clear metrics and the long-term value each project brings to Mint Blockchain. We remain open to providing additional details or insights into the grant allocation process upon request.
