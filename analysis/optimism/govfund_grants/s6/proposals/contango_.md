**Please briefly answer all project details questions**

1) Brief description of the project and what it aims to achieve: Contango is the looping layer of defi. It lets you loop anything on-chain. You can create leverage (re)staking positions, arb rates differentials, farm points, or simply go long or short like a perp at low funding. It aims at becoming the generalized looping layer of defi, across any chain and market. Since its v2 launch (October 2023), Contango racked up $3B in total volume and an ATH open interest of $350M. ü§Ø 2) Success potential: Looping is the #1 trading activity performed in defi, since its inception. It's the crypto native way of trading with leverage: given a spot market and a lending market, users would normally try to earn some yield or reward on leverage by looping manually or through automations on said markets. The market demand for looping has been there since the beginning of the $COMP farming craze. And it's what still drives growth today to new chains, where often it's the first -if not the only- thing users can do. YBAs have further spurred the demand for looping. On the tech side, Contango has already developed and perfected the two key components needed to deliver a top-notch looping platform: All logic at the smart contract level to handle all possible trading scenarios (open, modify, close, migrate positions). These contracts are audited and have been battle-tested for a year already, with no critical issue found, and more than $40M in users' margin deposited. A complex and math-intensive front end, with both an advanced and simplified interface, that handles 13 money market integrations and taps into +20 spot aggregators. This front end has been perfected through community inputs and has been praised by defi builders and retail users alike. The ability of the Contango team (6 people) to deliver high quality features and support is well-known in defi, across builders and community alike. ü´° Contango market fit can be observed through its Dune charts (always up and to the right). 3) Mission alignment: Doesn't get any simpler than this: Contango offers looping on YBAs by performing actions on spot and lending markets. Higher open interest on Contango drives growth and revenue to lending markets; higher volume on Contango drives growth and revenue to spot markets. Simply put: Contango is everyone‚Äôs best friend. ü§ó This 100% aligns with current MRs geared towards achieving dominance on YBAs on Optimism by stimulating activity on dexes and lending markets. YBAs already represent between 80% of Contango's open interest and volumes on Optimism ( source ). Incentivizing looping of YBAs on Contango guarantees a flywheel on underlying protocols. This has already proven true (and successful) with past grants on Contango, such as the S5 Optimism grant which achieved a 463x ROI, meaning that for every $ spent in OP rewards, Contango attracted $905 in open interest on underlying markets (more info below). üöÄ 4) Novelty: The novelty of Contango is evident when looking at its unique use cases and tech: Use cases: You can loop YBAs (Pendle's PT included) through a trading interface that handles multiple isolated positions, with key indicators such as: liquidation price, market impact on rates, time to break even . You can trade directional pairs, e.g. ETH/USDC, with the lowest and most stable funding rate in the industry (no joke: this academic study confirms it). You can arb funding rates across 10 chains and 13 markets, all in one platform. You can farm rewards, points, airdrops on leverage. Tech: Spot markets: Contango taps into Balmy.xyz SDK to query +20 dex aggregators and source the best price available in defi for a given trade. Lending markets: 13 markets have been added across 10 chains, with a dedicated integration for each to compute after-trade rates and help traders avoid market impact. 5) Will the project be open source? Yes, Contango smart contracts are already open-sourced, but protected by a business license. The front-end is proprietary code and as such is not open-source. 6) Free or fee-based for end users? Using Contango is currently free, but the contracts have built-in fees (set to 0 now). 7) Is it composable with other projects on Optimism? How? Contango is the most composable protocol ever: it's all built on the existing liquidity of spot and lending markets (good boy Contango üê∂). Protocols that Contango built upon on Optimism: Spot markets: 0x/Matcha, 1inch, Balancer, Balmy, Bebop, Changelly, DEX Conveyor, DODO, Enso, Kyberswap, LIFI, Magpie, Odos, Oku, OKX Dex, Open Ocean, Paraswap, Portalsfi, Rango, Squid, Uniswap, XY Finance. This is achieved via an integration with Balmy.xyz SDK. Lending markets: Aave, Compound, Moonwell, Exactly, Silo.

**Please briefly answer all market analysis questions**

1) Competitors and differentiation If you compare Contango to other trading platforms, in terms of open interest (OI) it's clearly outperforming major OGs in the derivative space: A recap of the main advantages of Contango compared to some of these platforms can be found here . Given its design and the high share of YBAs loops of the total OI, Contango can also be compared to other leverage products like Instadapp, DefiSaver and Summerfi, which also function as front-ends for money markets. A recap of the main advantages of Contango compared to these platforms can be found here . 2) Current user base and estimation method Daily active users : 80-120 Weekly active users : 500-800 Monthly active users : 2000-2500 Estimation method: check the 3 queries above on Dune.

**Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions**

1) Steps to increase user interaction The incentivization mechanism is simple: Incentivise APY ‚Üí less cost / higher APY for users ‚Üí more new users ‚Üí more OI and TVL ‚Üí more sticky users. We provide more details of this in the 'Budget and Plan' section below. 2) Target audience characteristics YBAs loopers: any user from major LSTs and LRTs providers, such as Lido, Rocketpool, Etherfi, Renzo, KelpDAO, Sfrax. This audience is complex: it consist of both advanced and inexperienced users. We're particularly wary of inexperienced ones, as trading YBAs on L2s is a complex endeavour. To prevent anyone from bleeding money on a position that is supposed to generate a positive ROE (these are all carry trades on the bearing yield) Contango has produced plenty of docs on the subject, such as this article . 3) User interaction with Optimism Given that Contango aggregates liquidity from spot and lending markets it's a nice hub for all-things Optimism. Indeed that's the vision underpinning Contango: a derivative layer built on top of defi pillars like spot and money markets. Users who find their home on Optimism when swapping or lending, will find Contango the perfect looping solution as it taps into protocols they might already know. So it'll be easier and more relatable, and induce them to stick around. The huge amount of arb opportunities and delta neutral plays within Optimism markets and between Optimism and other chains will also help retain newcomers: even if users come for the sole purpose of farming OP rewards instead of trading, they will have to open a delta-neutral position (e.g. on Aave and Compound) and will help bring defi rates in equilibrium across chains and markets. 4) Competitors on Optimism Considering this MR scope, we feel that Contango has no competitors as it nicely sits at the intersection of spot and lending markets, without competing with them (quite the contrary: it drives growth to them). At a broader level, competitors on the looping segment on Optimism are: Summerfi, Gearbox, Defi Saver, Instadapp. And competitors on the derivative segment are: Kwenta and Perp Protocol (although YBAs are not in their offering).

**Select the metric specified in the mission request**

(Intent 3 Growth) TVL in grantee‚Äôs protocol

**Fill out your metric objective**

Target: a 10% increase in TVL at the end of the campaign compared with the start (please note, however, that TVL and Open Interest on Contango are directly related to the ongoing market prices, e.g. traders might close their positions when markets go down; as such, Contango's TVL is hardly comparable to the TVL of a spot or lending market, where ongoing prices don't have such an immediate impact). 

**Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions**

Budget The 100,000 OP request is based on similar incentives campaigns carried out in 2024. Generally, incentives above $100K have a significant impact on Contango. We believe the ROI of past campaigns and the stickiness of users after each one of them ended, justifies the current budget: Optimism grant: 463x ROI, meaning that for every $ spent in OP rewards, Contango attracted $463 in open interest. Superfest grant: 443x ROI. Compound grant: 905x ROI. Arbitrum grant: 426x ROI. Plan The incentivization mechanism is simple: Incentivise APY ‚Üí less cost / higher APY for users ‚Üí more new users ‚Üí more OI and TVL ‚Üí more sticky users. This incentives campaign will last 12 weeks. Only long positions on YBAs will be incentivized. OP distribution will be computed off-chain and will happen: a) bi-weekly every Wednesday through a Merkl aidrop or b) as claimable rewards on the Contango UI, via Contango's own distributor. Each user will receive OP rewards proportional to the ongoing open interest for YBAs instruments. During the 12 weeks campaign, a specific number of OP will be allocated each minute, e.g. 100,000 /12/7/24/60 = 0.82 OP. That amount of OP is allocated across all the current OI of positions with YBAs. This allows us to compute and display on the UI an indicative extra APR that users will receive: 100% of rewards will be directed to end users of Contango on Optimism, i.e. users trading on any YBAs available on the Optimism markets of Aave, Compound, Moonwell, Exactly, Silo (or any other market that could be integrated by the start of the campaign). Please note: if the underlying market will also be offering incentives as part of the same MR or other grants, Contango users will also be earning those rewards; the UI will be able to show a breakdown of rewards, labelling each source separately (e.g. Contango vs Silo): Since rewards are meant as extra APR , open interest (OI) is directly incentivized. OI on Contango is the sum of lending positions on the underlying money markets. The higher the OI, the longer users stay involved on the platform. A higher OI means a higher Contango TVL, a higher underlying money market TVL and a higher Optimism TVL. The best metric to measure the stickiness of users on the platform is thus OI (=TVL). Please note that: Increasing OI is a very good proxy to increase volumes too, but focusing on OI allows us to have a sybil and wash-trading resistant mechanism, as users are not incentivized to split their positions across multiple wallets nor open/close positions in a few minutes. Contango can‚Äôt incentivize trading by offering trading fee rebates as it already has 0 trading fees.

**Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions**

1) Problem solved for Optimism Contango has brought to Optimism a looping platform that drives growth to all its spot and lending markets. Contango aggregates liquidity instead of fragmenting it. It allows users to loop on YBAs easily, with a few clicks. 2) Value proposition Contango is already generating revenue and bringing growth to Optimism. It generates revenues as more transactions are being processed without unnecessarily fragmenting existing liquidity. It‚Äôs bringing extra growth in the form of more volumes to both spot and lending markets. 3) Growth potential for Optimism and 4) Commitment to building on Optimism We already integrated all major spot and lending markets of Optimism. If new markets arise we'll gladly integrate them. 5) Deployment status (exclusively on Optimism, on Optimism and other networks, not yet deployed, etc.): On Optimism and other networks.
