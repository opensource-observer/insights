Mode 

**Description of the existing grants program, if applicable.**

Mode does not have an existing grants program, but we're working on a well-thought program based on the learnings and experiences from Optimism. This grants will give Mode the possibility to build a grants program. We do have an accelerator to support projects that want to be Mode native first and then go multi-chain on the Superchain. https://www.mode.network/yield-accelerator This accelerator includes 14 vetted projects in it’s first cohort and we are starting a new one in the coming weeks. As part of our grants program, we plan on offering continued support to these high-quality projects. We will be running following cohorts with new projects focusing on new narratives, our next one is focused on AI + DeFi.

**Defined Process:**

Grant application submissions will happen on a rolling basis and will be processed as they come in. Grants will be submitted via a google form. (draft here ) As grants come in, they will be reviewed in two steps: Intake phase - Grants applications are reviewed by 1 team member for the following pass/fail criteria: a. Completeness b. Within scope of grants program c. Follows grant rules Review phase - Grants are reviewed by a minimum of 3 team members on a standard rubric. ( Draft Rubric ) - If grants meet a threshold score (TBD) they will pass the review stage and move on to distribution - Threshold score increases based on grant size request - Any Mode team member will have a “golden buzzer” for high-conviction projects that will have them pass the review phase regardless of score. Distribution Distribution for growth style user-incentives grants will be distributed immediately after the application passes User-incentives grants will not be milestones based and are meant for a single request. Protocols can re-apply for more grant funds if their incentive campaign is successful or is in process and showing signs of success. Goal-metrics for user incentive grants will be required in the application, but achievement of these goals will only affect future grant applications, not the distribution for this initial grant application. Distribution for locked builders grants will only happen after 12 months of the grant approval and is contingent on the completion of pre-approved milestones.

**Intent #3B Alignment:**

For the past few months, we have been focusing on fostering a healthy and active DeFi ecosystem filled with opportunities for users. Our goal with this grants program is not only to make Mode the DeFi playground of the Superchain, but also to serve as a launchpad for projects that want to expand across the Superchain. We want to use this grants program to make this “DefI playground” the most vibrant of any crypto ecosystem. All of our program mandates aim at empowering and increasing the incentives for developers and founders to become active participants in the Mode ecosystem. This grants program will allow us to incentivize emerging and existing projects to not only come to Mode but also run growth campaigns to attract more users and activity.

**OP Chain Contribution:**

Previous work and contributions w/ quantitative metrics: The following chart shows the past metrics as compared to other protocols excluding Base** as well as a OP distribution for each of those metrics for 9 million OP worth of grants programs. Protocols and contribution data is pulled directly from the Superchain Health Dashboard. As you can see, Mode is the clear leader in every metric , and when comparing to other chains based directly on these metrics, the proportional amount of OP based on a quantitative distribution is greater than 5 million. An explanation and source of each metric is outlined below. Past Contributions (last 6 months): Direct contributions are the ultimate measure for chains in the Superchain, and our goal with this grant is to return much more than the value of OP to the collective. We discuss potential future contributions below and why they can pay back the 3million OP, but it is clear from the data that mode has been the largest contributor of OP recently by an order of magnitude, only second to Base. The data is the total contributions for the last 6 months. In cases where a chain did not have any actual contributions, “estimated contributions” was used in order to give them the benefit of the doubt. Source: Superchain Health Dashboard - Collective Contribution Detail Total TVL: TVL represents the “potential energy” of a chain, and Mode is a clear leader in this regard even after the slight decline in TVL from the airdrop. New protocols are more incentivized to launch or deploy on Mode because of this liquidity. As new protocols deploy on Mode, there is already a reservoir of liquidity onchain to achieve critical mass for the applications that need it. In terms of the grants program, this allows Mode to target higher quality teams for our accelerator program to launch native projects and higher quality protocols for our Mode Momentum program to launch and bring TVL with them from outside the Superchain. It is also important to note that if the Superchain ever monetized the value stored in its bridge, Mode would immediately be contributing a significant amount of revenue. Source: L2Beat Number of Protocols: To-date, there has been no chain in the Superchain that has done a more efficient job of onboarding large projects. In fact, many projects with $1B+ TVL have launched on Mode as their entrypoint into the Superchain, before even Base or OP Mainnet. These include Merlin (BTC), Ethena, Renzo, Kelp Dao, Stakestone, Astaria, and many more, in addition to the native projects like Ionic, Kim Exchange, Splice. This is important for two reasons: First, this shows that Mode has a history of successfully bringing protocols to their network with a fraction of the resources that Base and Optimism have. We will be able to supercharge and continue this efficiency with the grants program. Second, Mode already has a large ecosystem of Defi primitives. If capital moves to Mode during an incentives program, there is a large ecosystem for that capital to stay even after the incentive period ends. Source: DefiLlama Why exclude Base? There is a set maximum of 3m OP per chain and based on past contributions, it is obvious that Base “deserves” this the most. Assuming the goal of the grants program is maximum ROI per OP spent, it makes sense to consider what the best possible use of the remaining OP is. That said, we actually think that the Mode grants program may have a larger ROI than Base which we explain below. Return on Investment for the OP collective Accelerator Program + Mode’s BD team to-date: To have a high ROI on a grants program, there needs to be high-quality projects to give those grants to. As I’m sure you know from Optimism’s grants program, it can be hard to find enough high quality projects to use all funds. Mode has already been successfully operating its Yield Accelerator program for some time. These are highly vetted and incubated projects that will deploy natively on Mode. From this program, we have become intimately familiar with the needs of these new projects. For example, many are in a catch-22 looking to raise money to fund an audit, yet investors want an audit before they raise money. Mode will instantly be able to use grants to solve bottlenecks for these vetted and native projects. Mode has previously had success enticing established multi-chain projects to deploy, even though it is a smaller chain with limited resources. With our Mode Momentum grants program, we will be able to accelerate this success and bring new large protocols and their users into the Superchain. Network effects: Arbitrum, Base, and OP Mainnet are examples of protocols that have already hit “escape velocity” with self-sustaining and accelerating ecosystems. Having another Superchain chain in this category would be invaluable to Optimism. Mode is clearly the next-closest chain in the Superchain, and based on everything we've laid out, we believe that we will be able to efficiently use the OP from the grants program to get us to that state. Non-linear Contributions Growth: This is a slightly more technical point, but below you can see the gas per second used by chains in the Superchain. Once any chain hits their “gas target”, EIP 1559 kicks in and the “base fee” for transactions begins to rise, increasing sequencer revenue and therefore revenue to the Optimism Collective. As you can see, Mode has bumped up against this target many times already (one reason why their contribution is much larger to-date than other protocols). By doubling activity on Mode, the revenue contributions actually begin to accelerate in a non-linear way. Mode is an extremely lean and scrappy team that has achieved moderate success with limited resources. A 3 million OP grant would make a HUGE marginal difference to Mode and has the potential to drive Mode into the top tiers of L2s. Some extra points to consider: Based on this dune query, which is a fork of the official OP Labs contribution dashboard, Mode makes up 41.8% of superchain contributions to date excluding OP Mainnet and Base. Mode already has an ecosystem of projects that are deployed & interested in deploying, as well as fundamental infrastracture such as DeFi building blocks & oracles. Mode has consistently served as a launching pad for the defi projects into the superchain. Astaria, Renzo, KelpDAO, Ionic, Merlin BTC, and many more all launched on Mode before other superchain chains. Our goal is to keep bringing existing projects into Mode first to then go superchain. We have also contributed to the pool of the OP Superchain competitive audit done by code4rena and plan on keep participating in such activities.(https://x.com/code4rena/status/1823110091987661217).

**Grants Allocation Framework:**

The Grants Allocation Framework comprises two distinct programs, each offering 1.5M OP to eligible projects. Grantees can qualify for only one program at a time. The two programs—Yield Accelerator and Mode Momentum—are designed to support projects at various stages of development, all with the overarching goal of fulfilling the Defined Mandate above. Yield Accelerator  100K OP (100k for Builder Grant) Description: A quarterly, open-to-public program targeting 15 teams per cycle, offering hands-on support to launch new projects on Mode. The program focuses on fostering meaningful innovation and developing new mechanisms that drive user adoption. Within a year, It is anticipated that at least 10 new projects will be deployed on Mode, assuming an 80% success rate of teams making significant progress and graduating from the program. The grant will consist of 100k OP Builder Grant. This amount will be enough to cover for the AIFi accelerator cohort hosting 1 program. Target stage: This program targets MVP-to-testnet stage projects that require a final push to fully develop their products, with a go-to-market timeline of 1-3 months. Elegibility: Projects successfully graduated the program will receive the grants to cover the product development, security audit cost, and bootstrap early users. Grants are reviewed by a minimum of 3 team members on a standard rubric ( Mode Grants Rubric Draft ). The projects are expected to expand to the Superchain ecosystem and deploy on other chains after the launch on Mode. Mode Momentum 900k OP (900K for User Incentive) Description: This program operates on a rolling basis, activated when existing projects on Mode demonstrate significant and measurable improvements in traction and user adoption. For instance, if a multichain project with a $500M TVL deploys on Mode and successfully transfers 10% of its TVL from other chains (outside the Superchain ecosystem) to Mode, the project can retroactively apply for this grant as a reward. The goal of this program is to attract well-known protocols to the Mode ecosystem, thereby enhancing market awareness and credibility for Mode. Target stage: This program targets mature projects that have been fully developed and operational on Mode for at least 3 months. Elegibility: This program is designed to incentivize the growth of mature projects on Mode, specifically addressing the challenge of multichain deployment that does not directly result in user adoption from other ecosystems or TVL migration from other chains outside of superchain. To be eligible, a protocol must deploy on Mode and demonstrate that it has migrated at least 10% of its TVL to Mode. To distinguish between early-stage and mature-stage projects, the project must have a minimum of $25M in TVL(data will be sourced and tracked from Defillama at the time of deployment) across all chains (outside of the Superchain ecosystem). Allocation Eligibility Review Process All applications from the above 2 defined programs will go through a two-step process. Mode team will provide feedback on grant sizes that teams request in the application process. We are expecting to give grants of sizes 5K-100K USD for most projects. The main idea is to give "smaller" sized grants but to have a fast paced approval to keep supporting the teams that demonstrate an ability to grow and manage these funds in a proper manner. Intake phase Grants applications are reviewed by 1 team member for the following pass/fail criteria: Commpleteness Within scope of grants program Follows grant rules Review phase Grants are reviewed by a minimum of 3 team members on a standard rubric (Mode Grants Rubric Draft) If grants meet a threshold score (TBD) they will pass the review stage and move on to distribution Threshold score increases based on grant size request Any Mode team member will have a “golden buzzer” for high-conviction projects that will have them pass the review phase regardless of score. This grants program will encompass a blend of three distinct approaches: Open-Ended Competitive Grants Program with Public Applications: This will allow for a wide range of projects to apply for funding, leaving an open end for new projects to contact our team for support. We want to be as open to the community as possible. Invite-Only Competitive Grants Program: This component will target strategic projects that align closely with our ecosystem’s objectives, allowing us to support key initiatives proactively. It will help our BD and Ecosystem team to utilize this grant as a tool to help the growth in the Mode and Superchain ecosystem. Support for Pre-Identified Grantees: We aim to formalize the support for pre-identified projects that are already part of our pipeline. These projects have shown significant potential and require our assistance to scale effectively. Currently, we have more than 10 projects, including BMX, Ironclad, Charged Particles, Reserve, Splice, Ionic, Giza (AI agents), and Gyro, ready to launch growth campaigns under this program. Collectively, these projects represent a substantial opportunity to expand and strengthen our ecosystem. The balance between these different grant types will be flexible, allowing us to respond dynamically to the evolving needs of our ecosystem while ensuring that both new and established projects receive the support they need.

**Target Metrics:**

Mandate 1 Foster User Engagement and Growth: ⁠# of new accounts created. This number can be used as a proxy of user engagement and growth. we can set quarterly goals e.g. 15%  quarterly growth rate; this means roughly 300K new accounts in a year. ⁠ # of transactions . This number is less optimal for this mandate but it can be somewhat supplementary to the first one. DEX Volume: Mode is #19 w. ~13M in daily volume, in the mid-term we'd like to get to top 10. DEX TVL (filter the chart above by "DEX TVL": Mode is at #48 w. ~13M in TVL. this is where we need a lot more improvement and where the OP incentives would play a critical part to get this DEX TVL number up so that we can support larger trades with less price impact and slippage DEX volume is at the heart of onchain activity for Defi, which also unlocks other areas of defi growth such as lending (more depth to handle larger liquidations means lending protocols can handle larger borrowing needs). While we are off to a great start, we can take things to the next level with the right amount of support from the OP grants. Improving DEX liquidity and TVL will also Mode to grow even faster all all cylinders Stickiness: The number of active addresses and the percentage of retained active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts The total amount of gas fees generated from grantee’s contracts Mandate 2 Promote Innovation and User Adoption of Novel Protocols: # of unique applications deployed on Mode . We can define the uniqueness as not available in other ecosystems, or native token on mode with multichain strategy, or from our accelerator program. Mandate 3 Attract Established Multichain Protocols and Multichain Assets: For multichain established projects, the best metrics would be # of applications deployed and % of TVL of overall TVL of that project. Mandate 4 Invest in Infrastructure and Developer Tooling For developer tooling and infrastructure providers, we will use the # of testnet transactions emitting event logs and # of active developer addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts

**Milestones:**

TVL Milestones: $2 Billion TVL by September of 2025: The goal is to reach $2 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) before September of 2025. The current TVL of Mode is ~450M. This target is achievable through the deployment of new assets on Mode from both the Yield Accelerator and Growth Migration program. The target is to have at least 70% of the TVL in applications to ensure that it’s in actual use by the end users. We want to make sure our TVL is being useful for the ecosystem and a more meaningful metric. How to track: we will use DeFillama and L2beats to track daily numbers https://defillama.com/chain/Mode https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/mode Transaction Volume Milestones: 1,000,000 Average Transactions per Day by September 2025: The aim is to reach an average of 1,000,000 transactions per day by September 2025. As a reference, we are at about 130K daily transactions at the moment. This goal will be supported by the increasing use of Mode through the integration of Mode with various new applications that will deploy on Mode through this grant program. Not only just Mode, we aim to bring new assets and new mechanisms around the asset through Yield accelerator, the goal of which is to foster innovation and unique utility within our ecosystem. How to track: we will use Mode explore to track daily number https://explorer.mode.network/stats Dex Volume/Activity Milestones: Dex Volume/Activity reach 50M by September 2025: The goal to reach an accumulative of 50M swaps transaction volume by the end of 2025. We are at 5M right now and 50M is achievable through the user incentives via this grant program and the listing of new assets from other applications. How to track: we will use token flow dashboard to track daily numbers: https://app.tokenflow.live/studio/dashboards/modedexs New Application Deployment Milestones: 100 New applications deployed on Mode: By September 2025, we aim to bring 100 new applications in various categories to boost the usage of the chain. How to track: The dapps will register on DeFillama for the info of deployment to be publicly available. We will enforce projects to create their defi llama adapters to be added to the list.

**Impact Analysis:**

Impact Assessment:

The impact of the grants program will be assessed through a combination of key performance indicators (KPIs), periodic reviews, and continuous monitoring. The primary metrics for assessment will include TVL, transaction volumes, user engagement, and protocol adoption rates. Specific milestones will serve as benchmarks for success as mentioned in the above section. 

The tracking dashboards to be used are https://dune.com/sealaunch/mode-network https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/mode#tvl https://app.tokenflow.live/studio/dashboards/modedexs https://defillama.com/chain/Mode https://explorer.mode.network/stats Reporting:

To ensure transparency and accountability, the following reporting mechanisms will be implemented:

Monthly Reports: Detailed monthly reports will be provided, outlining the progress of the grants program, the utilization of funds, and the achievement of key milestones. These reports will include data on TVL growth, transaction volumes, and other relevant KPIs.

Real-Time Dashboard: A real-time dashboard will be available for stakeholders to monitor the grants program's performance continuously. This dashboard will provide up-to-date information on TVL, transaction volumes, and other key metrics, ensuring full transparency of grant distribution. 

End of program retrospective & reporting: Mode will create a comprehensive report at the conclusion of the program, covering the following questions
      - Biggest successes
      - Areas that need to improve
      - Evaluation on the program structure
      - Before and after analysis of all target metrics 

**Token Delivery:**

Mode will use a multisig to distribute grants to successful applicants after KYC. 

User incentive grants will be distributed at the time of KYC completion, and locked grants will be distributed 1 year after successful application if all milestones are completed. 

**Sustainability:**

The lessons learned during this program will be essential for any future grants programs. 

**External Contributions:**

We are looking into several tools that will support this program and it's tracking to make it as accurate as possible.

Michael is helping the Mode team with both program design and operations.

We'll be looking for direct feedback on our grants program from members of the Optimism Grants Council.
