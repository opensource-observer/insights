The FastLZ algorithm is a fast and accurate approximation of the Brotli compression used to compress calldata. This allows both Optimism and end users to save more money on L1 blob fees.\n\n- Solady also allows the OP stack's smart contracts to save gas on L1 (e.g. MerkleProofLib, LibClone), which allows more cost savings for Optimism. These smart contracts have also been thoroughly tested and audited, enabling safer code. It also helps with making L2 smart contracts more efficient, so that the Superchain can accommodate more end users. ",

Almost all the smart contracts on OP Stack runs on EVM and we start providing access to Move smart contract execution.\n\nWe also started working on a zkMove implementation that will be used for ZK proof. As it turns out, it's easier to port ZK computation on a Move contract than a Solidity contract, because the Move bytecodes are a lot more similar to assembly language than the EVM bytecodes which makes them easier to transform into ZK computation language.",

By contributing to the Typescript implementation, testing infrastructure and maintaining other libraries required for its success (such as nodeJS bindings for c-kzg), we were able to deliver this feature for the benefit of OP. In addition, EIPs such as EIP-4788 allows for embedding L1 beacon block roots into Layer 2 to reduce trust assumptions relating to Ethereum's consensus state. ",

Our work contributes to the backbone infrastructure required to keep the Ethereum blockchain progressing within the rules as defined by the specification.\n\nLodestar’s niche is in its implementation language, TypeScript. Our software and tooling is uniquely situated as the go-to for researchers and developers for rapid prototyping such as our Prover, a verified web3 provider using light clients to increase decentralization and security of the JSON-RPC. Millions of developers around the world are familiar with Typescript, and Lodestar’s high-quality codebases are excellent introductions to the Ethereum protocol, with the goal of increasing client diversity and attracting new talent from one of the largest groups of developers in the world.",

These are the Ethereum Electra Fork, PeerDAS and network R&D. \n\nThe Electra Ethereum fork is a core milestone and planned upgrade for Ethereum. It contains a number of upgrades for the core Ethereum network which indirectly benefits the OP stack. \n\nPeerDAS has a more direct benefit for the OP stack. With PeerDAS we are aiming to reduce the load on individual nodes to increase the throughput of the layer 1 chain. This should result in lower gas fees for OP and improve the scalability of the entire Ethereum and layer 2 ecosystems.\n\nWe have been working on structures and improvements for our networking layer which is used not only in Lighthouse but as dependencies for an OP node implementation. We defer this work to a separate project, rust-libp2p and omit it from this one.",

By integrating Optimism clients into the Dappnode Rollups menu, it simplifies node setup and maintenance, boosting network participation and resilience. The launch of the Smooth MEV Smoothing Pool incentivizes solo stakers with increased rewards, contributing to the economic security of the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\nAdditionally, Dappnode's Driving School tutorial series has been key in onboarding new users by simplifying node syncing, thereby supporting a broader base of node operators. The integration of the Holesky testnet and support for Holesky MEV Boost ensure that developers and stakers have access to the latest testing environments. Improvements in Ethical Metrics and Dencun upgrades further demonstrate Dappnode's commitment to addressing the evolving needs of node operators.",

        "answer": "If Dappnode ceased to exist, the OP Stack would be missing significant features . First, the ease of node setup and maintenance provided by the Dappnode platform would be lost, leading to a potential decrease in the number of independent nodes operating on the Ethereum network. This reduction in decentralization could make the network more vulnerable to centralization risks and diminish its overall resilience.\nThe absence of the Smooth MEV Smoothing Pool would likely result in reduced staking rewards for solo stakers, which could discourage participation from smaller, independent operators. This would concentrate staking power in the hands of larger entities, reducing the economic security and diversity of Ethereum that makes the OP Stack possible.",

Specifically, Sherlock conducted two separate contests for the Bedrock update, which plays a pivotal role in enhancing the scalability and efficiency of the OP Stack. In the first contest, Sherlock's security experts identified 13 Medium and 3 High vulnerabilities. The second contest further uncovered 6 Medium and 3 High vulnerabilities. By identifying and helping to remediate these vulnerabilities, Sherlock has ensured that the Bedrock update is robust, secure, and ready for deployment, ultimately contributing to the stability and security of the entire OP Stack. Additionally, Sherlock ran an audit contest for Optimism Fault Proofs, a critical element of the Optimism architecture, further securing the OP Stack against potential exploits.",

      "description": "JEFETOKEN is a software development project focused on smart contracts, blockchain technology, video games & mobile applications. Our goal is to create an ecosystem of web3 applications, based on our own token that powers our platforms and services. Additionally, we offer education through interactive workshops, both in-person and digital, to facilitate user integration into the blockchain ecosystem.\nBlockchain: The JEFE token is developed Open source under the MIT license,  coded in Solidity and forms the foundation of the project, deployed on the mainnet in Optimism as $JEFE with the vision of being part of the SUPERCHAIN.\n\nApplication Development: We implement web3 activities within the community, promoting healthy competition through participation in educational workshops and learning activities on blockchain usage. All information is accessible to users from our website and with direct support on our social media channels. We have our own video game, Jefe Zombie, available on Android and iOS. This game introduces users to using their ERC-20 address to rank within the community and earn on-chain rewards, such as $JEFE & NFTs, and off-chain rewards, such as game appearances & accessories.\n\nCommunity Support: We also support community talent in areas like sports (American football and paintball), audiovisual art, helping artists transition to the web3 world, and e-sports, promoting competition and game streaming among users.\n\nJEFE University: We have JEFE University, a tour of presentations  and workshops at universities about Optimism, blockchain & web3. We generate POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) for attendees, promoting learning and knowledge sharing.\n\nRewards Program: We incentivize talent and user engagement within our ecosystem through a comprehensive rewards program, prominently featured on our website. Additionally, we're currently developing JEFE COMPASS, an innovative mobile Dapp where users can seamlessly monitor the global community ranking, organize activities, and track both on-chain and off-chain interactions from community addresses and VOTE for events, competitions, top players and more. By participating, users earn rewards points, enabling them to evolve their progress and level of their ranking within the community. \nThis program recurrently lists community activities that integrate web3, providing an access point to understand the use case of JEFE TOKEN. We act as a compass for navigating the web3 world, with a vision of a Superchain. Our utility is to support the transition from web2 to its integration with the Superchain in web3 interactively.",

The potential main benefit will be a significant gas reduction for the challenger over the whole game and a reduction in fault proof window.\n- We expect the additional gas cost of move() will be minimal: the additional fee will be mainly BLOB fee for each move(). \n- The code changes to FaultDisputeGame.sol will be minimized, and the existing definitions such as Position, Depth, MIPS.sol, etc will be retained. Further, the N-section fault-proof game would subsume bisect FaultDisputeGame.sol when N=2. Therefore, all existing tests (unit tests, e2e tests) for FaultDisputeGame.sol can be also used to test the new multi-section fault-proof game.\n- We've generalized the fault proof contract tests from Nary=1 to Nary>=2.",

      "description": "EthStorage is dedicated to advancing the next generation of Web3 infrastructure, focusing on areas such as data availability, Layer 2 scaling, multi-section fraud-proof, and decentralized storage. Our team has contributed to several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including EIP-4804, EIP-4972, EIP-5018, and EIP-5027. We have also been awarded multiple grants from the Ethereum Foundation, notably for projects like data availability sampling and proving Layer 2 storage through Layer 1 contracts.\n\nThis research aims to significantly expedite the fault-proof dispute by implementing a multi-section search approach. In contrast to the bi-section game, which demands log2(N) moves to identify the final disputable step, the K-section game (where K > 2) diminishes the moves to logK(N). However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move. The introduction of EIP-4844 facilitates a substantial reduction in this cost through the utilization of EIP-4844 Binary Large Object (BLOB), capable of accommodating K=4096 VM hashes per BLOB. This allows the dispute process for an N=2^48 game to be resolved in just 4 moves, down from 48, facilitating quicker settlements and lowering gas costs.",

It enhances the ecosystem in the following ways: \n\n- By enabling Optimism stack to run on affordable ARM64 devices, we lower the barrier to entry for users who may not have access to high-powered hardware. This contributes to network decentralization.\n\n- Ethereum on ARM reduces the complexity of setting up and managing Optimism nodes by consolidating all necessary configurations, binaries, and scripts into images the make it easy to run nodes and accelerate the onboarding process for new users. \n\n- The capability to run both L1 (Ethereum) and L2 (Optimism) nodes on the same ARM64 device allows for a more integrated and efficient setup, where users can support both layers of the OP Stack simultaneously. This contributes to the robustness and resilience of the Optimism network by encouraging more users to run full nodes.",

By lowering these barriers, we ensure that both Ethereum L1 and L2 nodes can be operated by any user from home. This accessibility is important for enhancing the decentralization, security, and scalability of the Ethereum network.\n\nWithout this reference, the hardware requirements and costs associated with running a node could increase, potentially restricting participation to only those with more resources.

They moved the chain from Stage 0 to Stage 1 decentralization, and solidified the OP Stack as a full featured rollup stack for other teams to build on. The security of this feature is paramount to the trust in the system.\n\nWhile OP Labs has traditionally been responsible for audits, there are times when their audit framework doesn't match with the security priorities of the community. This contest represents the community filling this gap with a successful security engagement.\n\nThe results speak for themselves:\n- 5 High severity vulnerabilities found, multiple of which would have required using the safeguards to freeze the bridge to secure funds\n- 11 Medium severity issues, as well as numerous smaller fixes\n- One of the main drivers of the Granite Network Upgrade, which majorly upgrades the security of OP Mainnet (and, eventually, the rest of the Superchain)",

This contest helped resolve multiple vulnerabilities that would have required Security Council interference to keep funds safe.\n\n2) OP Token Holders: A Security Council override to freeze the bridge would have caused major damage to OP's reputation, and likely would have caused a major reduction in OP's token value.\n\n3) Superchain: The rest of the Superchain will be using these contracts, and may not have the diligence in safeguards that OP Mainnet has.

      "description": "The Fault Dispute Game Audit Contest was run from July 15-29th to secure the Superchain by looking for bugs in the Fault Dispute Game contracts.\n\nAfter learning that the OP Labs Audit Framework led to a decision to not fund an audit for the Fault Dispute Game (because the safeguards around it were carefully audited), this project was initiated to bring the top security talent in the space together to secure this crucial piece of infrastructure.\n\nThe result was a two week contest featuring legends like samczsun (the GOAT of whitehats), cts (founder of Zellic), Riley Holterhus (Spearbit Lead Security Researcher), pwning.eth (3rd place on Immunefi all time leaderboard), xuwinnie (winner of the largest audit contest pot of all time), as well as 1000+ other researchers.\n\nThis format proved very effective. The contest uncovered 5 High severity vulnerabilities, as well as 11 Medium severity issues and numerous smaller improvements. These findings spurred the Granite network upgrade (https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-10-granite-network-upgrade/8733).\n\nMy role was to bring the full audit from idea to completion with the best possible results and minimal time commitment from the OP Labs team. This included:\n- Identifying that this was an important issue for Superchain security, writing the Mission Request, applying, and securing the funding to run the contest.\n- Determining the optimal format to use the funds to find bugs. After discussing an on chain CTF format, decided with OP Labs team that a contest (with some added features) would work best.\n- Negotiating with contest platforms to get the most appealing deal. In the end, Code4rena hosted the contest at zero fee (their typical fee would be 60k OP on a contest of this size).\n- Recruiting top auditors to focus their full time attention on this contest. Selected folks specifically who had the relevant skills for the codebase and worked with them to put together a deal.\n- Took the role of OP Labs representative in organizing the contest: writing scoping documents, organizing the contest repo, putting together ideas to focus researcher attention on the right areas of the codebase, hosting a livestream to walk through the codebase at kickoff, etc.\n- Answering all participant questions during the contest to ensure every valid idea was fully explored.\n- Judging the contest, reviewing all submissions, deduplicating issues, assessing the validity (with the support of OP Labs on final decisions), and putting together the final issues list for the OP Labs team to fix.",

We are only focus on Ethereum and Layer2. \n\nour vision:\n\nWe hope we could not only give junior developers a feasible and easy-to-use **blockchain Dapp learning roadmap**, but also present advanced developers with a platform for **communication and cooperation**.\n\nWhat We Have Done\n\n- We maintain a widely acclaimed open-source web3 development tutorial on GitHub,  covering the fundamentals of web3 development, in-depth analysis of DeFi, CRYPTO, DAO，blockchain architecture and more. The Basic tasks  enable beginners to get the hang of web3 basics through coding examples, while the Project task section delves in to the architecture and processes of classic projects and dissects the key logic within the code。\n- Adhering to the concept of the open-source university, we regularly hold online tech-sharing sessions (typically once a week), with over 180 deep dives into hard-core technical topics. They're all up on platforms like YouTube and Bilibili for people to catch up on. For critical technologies or topics, we have organized several lecture series, such as DeFi series, ZK Series Courses, Optimism, Starknet, Scroll, UniswapV3, Account Abstraction, etc. Excellent presenters would receive a 160 DAI reward provided by the community funding pool.\n- We have a special team to translate influential English courses or articles into Chinese, making them accessible to a broader range of Chinese developers. To help learners understand the entire web3 industry's context and improve systemic cognition, we have organized the content of MIT 15.S12 Blockchain and Money (Prof. Gary Gensler) video course and translated it into Chinese version course notes.\n- We've built a community system using Ethereum Address as an identity marker, offering platforms for hiring and bounties alongside practical web3 tools like Redpacket and Airdrop, etc., on which we support layer2 (Optimism, Arbitrum one, scroll, zkSync Era, etc). We're continuously enhancing our community features with the goal of providing an enriched experience for our developers. We aim to foster learning, facilitate collaboration, and unlock new opportunities within the community.\n- We adhere to a DAO governance, decentralized, with global contributors, voting on significant community .\n\n",

In this world, users will no longer have to wait 7 days to withdraw funds from a rollup, they will have seamless interoperability across ecosystems, and capital efficiency and verifiability will dramatically improve. With OP Succinct rollups, we have all of these benefits, with a simple developer experience for rollup teams that allows for customization and maintainability. \n\nWith OP Succinct rollups, we can have it all.\n\nAny of the following can leverage this work:\n\nTeam exploring new rollup options: If your team is exploring deploying a rollup and wants to learn more about OP Succinct rollups as an option.\nRaaS teams: If you’re a RaaS team and you want to offer OP Succinct rollups as part of your platform (deployment should be very easy)!\nExisting rollup team: If your team currently has a rollup and wants to migrate it from optimistic to ZK or generally explore migrating to OP Succinct rollups.\n",

Acting as a light node of sorts, Hermes can help developers collect valuable data and tune their network’s protocols based on the message propagation latency, control message overhead and a variety of other metrics. Hermes currently supports the Ethereum consensus layer network.\n\nThe ProbeLab team specialises in network-layer measurements and monitoring. The team operates a variety of tools and uses the data it collects to propose network protocol optimisations.",

Act specifications are a formal, high-level description of all possible behaviours of an EVM program. Act allows many existing general purpose verification tools to be leveraged to prove properties about the specification. Such tools include SMT solvers (cvc5, z3, bitwuzla), theorem provers (Coq) and economic analysis tooling (CheckMate, Open Games). Act specifications can be automatically proved equivalent to concrete implementations in EVM. For very simple contracts, Act specifications can be automatically generated from EVM bytecode.\n\nThis is an end-to-end pipeline that supports principled reasoning about high level properties of EVM bytecode. It supports reasoning about both correctness (e.g. accounting invariants) and economic properties (e.g. incentive compatibility). Act specifications serve as a high-level smart contract representation, allowing for easy integration of existing general purpose analysis and verification tooling into the EVM context.",

Additionally, future updates to the L1 and L2 contracts of Optimism might need to be rewritten in another language due to missing updates and security patterns in the language.\n\nIn conclusion, Solidity's existing impact on the OP Stack enables smart contract compatibility, smooth integration, and enhanced security. As the OP Stack continues to evolve, Solidity's role in its growth and adoption remains pivotal, ensuring a thriving and interoperable layer 2 ecosystem that leverages the Solidity's feature set and security patterns.",

However, the official signer client does not integrate with external signers, so we have implemented this functionality in our signer proxy.\n\nCurrently, the process outlined in the Optimism documentation for setting up a sequencer, batcher, and proposer requires using plain private keys, creating an insecure environment for mainnet deployment. Although the documentation suggests using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management, it lacks detailed guidance beyond referencing source code. Chain operators, particularly those using bare metal setups, often prefer YubiHSM2 over cloud-based solutions like AWS KMS due to its hardware-native security.\n\nTo enhance security, mainnet chain operators are encouraged to use industry-standard hardware signers like YubiHSM2 or AWS KMS. This approach allows operators to deploy Optimism stack chains securely by protecting private keys with hardware-based solutions. Existing resources, such as the integration of YubiHSM2 into the Keplr wallet and the TMKMS YubiHSM installer, provide relevant experiences that support this approach.\n\nOur AWS KMS Signer proxy has been used by the Lisk team for their op-challenger.

      "description": "The OP City Stack is a comprehensive research initiative focused on exploring the operation of the OP Stack and testing the capabilities of the Canon Fault Proofs Virtual Machine (Canon Fault Proofs VM). Through practical deployments, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project seeks to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project transitioned from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift improved performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor the Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs. The project also focused on analyzing memory management strategies for handlig large datasets required by machine learning models, and enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing. To ensure system integrity, formal verification, and error analysis were implemented. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance under real-world operational conditions.",

The main advantages for the Ethereum network are:\n1. Lower handshake latency: Establishing a libp2p-capable QUIC connection saves ~3 network roundtrips compared to TCP.\n2. Faster transfer performance due to built-in stream multiplexing, lack of head-of-line blocking, advanced loss recovery and congestion control.\n3. Easy interoperability: Every major programming language provides a QUIC interface. This is a significant simplification to the connection setup logic (multistream + Noise + mplex / yamux) necessary for TCP.",

Because of these benefits, we believe that Account Abstraction should be enshrined within the protocol, and we have been continuously working towards this goal.\n\nOne of the most important aspects is conducting all development processes in an open environment, and making it easy for anyone to test. To achieve this, Kroma team launched the public devnet Pioneer Alpha, which incorporates RIP-7560, RIP-7711, and RIP-7712 into the OP Stack.

Kroma has brought the OP Stack closer to decentralization and showcased the potential of using ZK proof for a Fault Proof system. Furthermore, this approach can contribute to a multi-proof system as a type of dispute game, enabling a more robust fault proof mechanism within the OP Stack. Moreover, when generating ZK proof becomes faster by utilizing Tachyon, it can enable the transition of the OP Stack to ZK rollups.",

Thanks to these decentralized validators, assets up to $30 million are securely stored on Kroma.\n\nOn April 1, the first incorrect checkpoint output was submitted on the mainnet. This marked the first challenge on mainnet within an optimistic rollup, and it was successfully resolved using our ZK Fault Proof system, securing the assets on Kroma. This demonstrated that our development can effectively secure assets on the OP Stack chain.\n\nAdditionally, we have improved our Fault Proof system. One of the main challenges we faced was the lengthy time required to generate a ZK proof for a single block. With our optimized modular ZK backend, Tachyon, we achieved a 150% increase in ZK proof generation speed, resulting in a 33% reduction in operational costs for the ZK prover.",

      "description": "Kroma is the first OP Stack rollup to feature an active, permissionless ZK Fault Proof system. This system allowed anyone to become a validator, who submits checkpoint outputs to L1 and validates them, thereby enabling the decentralized settlement of Kroma on L1.\n\nAdditionally, it reduced the costs associated with resolving disputes between different checkpoint outputs. It identifies the disputed point at the block level using multiple segments instead of bisection, requiring far fewer transactions. Moreover, it doesn’t necessitate storing large amounts of preimage oracle data on-chain, as verification can be achieved through ZK proofs. Operationally, we enhanced the ZK prover by reducing proof generation time using Tachyon, a Kroma original, GPU accelerated ZK backend library written in C++.\n\nHowever, there were several limitations in the existing system:\n- Maintaining the zkEVM circuit was challenging.\n- It did not guarantee that the execution of transactions was based on the batch data posted by the sequencer.\n- Compatibility with the interface of Optimism's DisputeGame was not considered.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, the Kroma team is developing an advanced ZK Fault Proof system using a zkVM. By using zkVM instead of zkEVM, no additional maintenance efforts are required for the ZK circuit. The new proving scheme ensures that transaction execution is based on the batch data posted by the sequencer. Additionally, the contract for dispute challenges will implement the interface of Optimism’s DisputeGame, making it fully compatible with Optimism's system. We anticipate that this could become one of the various dispute game types in the multi-proof system.",

      "description": "Optimism initially launched with single-shot fraud proofs (now called fault proofs).  I audited the architecture and implementation, and performed extensive research on risks associated with fraud proofs.  In the course of this research I found many vulnerabilities and implemented PoC exploits to demonstrate them.  Optimism did not have a bounty program at the time of this audit so I submitted the results without asking for compensation.\n\nAfter coordinating the disclosure with the OP team, I disclosed my research, Optimistic Time Travel: https://medium.com/infinitism/optimistic-time-travel-6680567f1864\n\nThe results led to the conclusion that single shot fraud proofs are unsafe and should be replaced with interactive fraud proofs.  The vulnerable implementation was disabled.  The architecture was redesigned and interactive fault proofs were introduced in an upgrade earlier this year: https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-protocol-upgrade-7-fault-proofs/8161/1\n\nWhile the research was published in 2022, its impact happened in 2024 when optimism upgraded to the new and safer fault proofs architecture.  Hence I'm submitting this security research in the OP stack research category \"Security audits specifically on the OP Stack or its components\".",

We provide multiple services that can be used by end users, contract deployers, institutions and projects building on ETH mainnet, OP, Base and Sepolia. GasHawk enables developers to cheaply and securely deploy/interact with dapps, driving considerable value to the Optimism ecosystem, help retain projects and developers, and unlock new application designs. GasHawk allows developers and users to transact/deploy on chain at any time and level of volatility, with confidence that they will get the best transaction fee available on chain, within their chosen time frame. GasHawk has also provided research and implementation into Optimisms Sequencer Address which shows we can save Optimism millions per year. We are now researching a blob based submission service to implement savings for OP, Base, Worldchain, and other chains built on the OP Stack.\n",

      "description": "The Book of Optimism Fault Proof\n\nThe Book of Optimism Fault Proof repository is a resource aimed at demystifying the fault proof system for newcomers and seasoned developers alike. Centered around the transformative concept of a fault proof system, this project shifts away from centralized proposers to a mechanism grounded in game theory. The purpose of this document is to offer a multifaceted explanation of the fault proof system, providing newcomers with a rapid understanding of its mechanics and the specific details of its code.\n\n1. Starting with the Basics\n\nThe journey into understanding fault proof begins with the simplest design of such a system. This approach breaks down the complexity of fault proof into manageable parts, making it easier for newcomers to grasp the fundamental concepts and how they interconnect within the broader system architecture.\n\n2. Key Components Explained\n\nFault Proof: At its core, the fault proof mechanism replaces centralized proposer systems, which are susceptible to biases and inefficiencies, with a decentralized, game-theory-based approach.\nFault Proof Game: This component employs a binary search technique to pinpoint and verify discrepancies between parties on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness in dispute resolution.\nCannon: An off-chain program, Cannon is pivotal in generating verifiable data needed for on-chain interactions, bridging the gap between theoretical fault proof and practical implementation.\nop-program: This tool provides the necessary prototype files for Cannon, facilitating services for pre-image data crucial for the system’s operations.\nop-challenger: Automating the gameplay elements of the fault proof system, op-challenger utilizes both Cannon and op-program to streamline processes and enhance system integrity.\n\n3. Architecture Mechanics\n\nUnderstanding the architecture of the fault proof system involves exploring how these components work together to form a robust mechanism. From the deployment of smart contracts and proxies on the Ethereum blockchain, identified by specific addresses such as MIPS and DisputeGameFactoryProxy, to the integration of off-chain computations with on-chain verifications, the architecture is designed for scalability and security.\n\n4. Comprehensive Resources\n\nFurther enriching this document, an extensive collection of articles and videos is summarized, providing deep dives into each component and the fault proof mechanism as a whole. These resources are meticulously curated to extend learning beyond the initial explanations, offering insights into potential applications and optimizations of the fault proof system.\n\n5. For Newcomers and Experts\n\nWhether you are a new entrant eager to understand the basics or an expert looking to refine your knowledge of decentralized systems, the repository offers a wealth of information designed to bring all readers up to speed on the innovative fault proof system.\n",

      "name": "Protocol Guild",
      "description": "Protocol Guild is a funding collective for 181 Ethereum Layer 1 R&D maintainers. These individuals come from 27 different ecosystem teams/projects and are the backbone of Ethereum's core protocol development. Protocol Guild ensures that funding goes directly to these individuals and Ethereum stewardship over the long term.\n----------------------------------\n\n--> Optimism's relationship with the Ethereum commons\n\nThe Ethereum commons is a broad set of peer-produced artifacts which share infrastructure or software resources. Optimism shares both with the Ethereum L1:\n\n1. Infrastructure relationships link the censorship resistance, security, and settlement of OP-stack L2s with the L1 network.\n\n2. Software powers the L1 distributed system and extensions of it, produced in part by the ongoing research and development of contributors supported through Protocol Guild. These individuals come from 27 different ecosystem teams and projects:\n\n- Client teams: Erigon, EthereumJS, Geth, Besu, Lighthouse, Lodestar, Nethermind, Nimbus, Prysm, Reth and Teku\n- Research groups: Applied Research Group, Consensys DDS, Consensus R&D, Ipsilon, Robust Incentives Group, Stateless Consensus and TXRX\n- Coordination & support groups: EELS, EthPandaOps, EthereumJS, EF Protocol Support, EF Protocol Security, EF Testing, Ethereum Cat Herders and Portal​​​​​​​\n\nOther impact includes:\n\n- the research, testing, and introduction of blobs through EIP-4844 (ie. proto-danksharding) in March 2024, has lowered L2 transaction costs by 10-100X\n- ongoing research into peerDAS and related constructions for the anticipated Pectra network upgrade, which will potentially lower the bandwidth requirements and/or further lower transaction costs for users\n- Optimism’s execution clients are modified L1 clients, which are maintained by Guild members\n- research, implementations, testing of EVM improvements. Optimism's EVM-equivalent architecture, makes the ecosystem more accessible to builders\n- ongoing maintainence of code-bases, support for network upgrades to make Ethereum more censorship resistant, secure, and accessible\n---------------------------------------\n\n--> A commons funding mechanism\n\nNo single individual/project could reproduce this software on their own. In recognition of this, the design of Protocol Guild is also grounded within the commons frame:\n\n1. Four year onchain vest, to individuals\n\nCommons stewardship plays out over time. Any funding drips slowly via immutable contracts to create legible guarantees for members + funders. Each member's share is time-weighted by their start date - which recognizes the local knowledge they've accumulated.\n\n2. Broad membership, regularly updated\n\nMembers come from +25 projects/teams across the entire Layer 1 contributor set. This wide-ranging curation ensures that less well known but equally impactful contributions are surfaced.\nThis membership is regularly updated onchain every quarter. When paired with the vest, this ensures funding goes to contributors that stick around long-term, or those that show up in the future - not just those that are around today.\n\nThrough these features, Protocol Guild is able to support long-term, transparent, & comprehensive Layer 1 stewardship.\n\n---------------------------\n--> \"Project\", not \"Org\"\n\nWithin the Retro Program context, Protocol Guild opts to represent itself as a \"Project\" instead of as an \"Organization.\"\n\n1. Fund the entire commons\n\nProtocol Guild aims to holistically fund the individuals engaged in Ethereum's core protocol , and not \"features\" or discrete projects of the protocol which will then compete against each other in the funding round.\n\n2. Funding, not project oversight\n\nProtocol Guild is scope-limited to allocate funding. The day-to-day activities of Ethereum projects/teams are not directed through Protocol Guild as an entity, or by any members in their affiliation as beneficiaries. Governance deliberations and roadmap decisions remain the responsibility of the broader community reaching rough consensus in public fora.\n\n3. Independent funding requests\n\nPresenting as an Organization with Projects might overlap with funding requests from individual core protocol projects/teams in the Retro round. These entities may have contributors/employees which are also members of Protocol Guild. However, these are are distinct entities from Protocol Guild itself. Protocol Guild funding goes directly to the individuals. In general, the membership does not have insight where this funding goes or how it is allocated.\n------------------------------\n\n--> Conclusion\n\nProtocol Guild’s design as a funding collective for individual Ethereum maintainers ensures that the network's ongoing evolution is sufficiently supported. By funding Protocol Guild through the Retro Program, badgeholders can ensure that it remains robust and capable of supporting innovations like Optimism.\n\nThank you for your consideration ❤️",

In op-node and OP stack, go-libp2p's  TCP transport, Connection Manager, Peerstore, Identify, AutoNAT & Ping protocols are used. As well as multiplexers like mplex and yamux, the TLS and Noise secure channels, and GossipSub for p2p messaging.\nIn the period between Oct 1 2023 - July 31 2024, go-libp2p has 3 major releases from v0.32.x to v0.35.x used in the OP stack and beacon chain. Major improvements include efficiencies like improving the dial prioritization logic to avoid spurious dials (Happy eyeballs for TCP), TLS encryption for TCP by default (for better performance), multiple improvements to the go-libp2p Resource manager, and more. Furthermore, in this period, go-libp2p has released multiple security fixes that improve the health of the Ethereum and Optimism mainnet.",

        "answer": "Because the Ethereum Beacon Chain and the OP stack are completely reliant on libp2p for its networking capabilities, if the go-libp2p project did not exist then both projects would have to have to write a libp2p implementation in Golang from scratch. A key yet understated feature that libp2p provides is interoperability across implementations in different languages. For example, a go-libp2p Prysm node can communicate with a rust-libp2p Lighthouse node seamlessly; without go-libp2p, there would be no Golang implementation to interoperate or form p2p networks with other language implementations. As a result, without go-libp2p Ethereum and the OP stack would lose a crucial libp2p implementation that powers the OP mainnet and a significant percentage of the Beacon Chain.",

The appropriate proof is automatically selected based on the configuration of the OP Stack chain.\n\nThe Opti.Domains ENS Gateway automatically upgrades in response to the OP Stack's transition from L2OutputOracle to Dispute Game, requiring no manual intervention or updates to the verifier contract or gateway server.\n\nThe ENS Gateway, specifically the EVMGateway, enables trustless cross-chain data retrieval for ENS names deployed on Layer 2 networks like Optimism with a CCIP Gateway. When an ENS name lookup occurs, the resolver reverts with OffchainLookup containing the gateway URL. The client then contacts the gateway, which returns the requested data. This data is passed to a callback function on the resolver for verification before being returned to the client as the final result of the name lookup.\n\nOur ENS Gateway has a mechanism to ensure liveliness even in the event that the respected dispute game type has suddenly changed, as seen in the recent proposal, 'Upgrade Proposal #10: Granite Network Upgrade,' by storing a backup dispute game type and only trusting its anchor state.\n\nOpti.Domains has also developed social verification and attestation to EAS in collaboration with Bored Town. We are on our way to scaling ENS to OP. We have contributed to the ENS OP Gateway development, which is currently under review by ENS core developers.\n\nThe Namespace team has expressed interest and reached out to us with questions about using our OP ENS Gateway.

This tight coupling enables more efficient communication & data transfer compared to relying on external services. Updates run smoother, compatibility issues drop, & the entire system operates more efficiently. Native modules redefine the boundaries of protocol design: Deep integration with core chain functionality unlocks advanced, new solutions, boosting performance far beyond what third-party integrations can achieve.",

      "name": "1-Click Price Oracle",
      "description": "Traditionally, price oracles are deployed on a per network basic (on each rollup individually). This manual deployment process can be lengthy, expensive, and may require legal agreements to be signed. Furthermore, prices are pushed to each rollup in a siloed manner, repeatedly incurring all associated overhead. Overall, there is a lot of duplicate computation taking place despite the underlying price data being identical. The traditional oracle architecture is unscalable in a world of 1000s of Rollups.\n\nGelato's 1-Click Price Oracles are natively integrated into rollups. These native oracles are immediately available without any manual deployment process and hyper scalable by leveraging a unique property of the rollup architecture. Prices are published to- and verified by a single rollup (Hub) and disseminated to all other rollups (Spokes) whilst avoiding duplicate computation and all associated overhead.\n\nThe key insight making this possible is that rollups essentially act as indexers over the L1 allowing us to consume data such as emitted events in a process known as derivation. The derivation layer is a crucial component as it facilitates, among other things, deposits which are initiated on the L1 and executed on the L2. This is what allows users on the L1 to securely deposit tokens to the L2.\n\nHere is how a deposit works under the hood:\n\n- The user invokes a smart contract which locks up tokens on the L1 and emits a deposited event.\n- Whenever the rollup enters a new epoch (new L1 block), it iterates through transaction receipts in that block and fetches all deposited event logs.\n- For all deposited event logs, the rollup constructs corresponding deposit transactions which are included at the top of the next L2 block.\n\nGelato 1-Click Price Oracles fork and slightly modify the OP Stack to introduce an additional source to the derivation layer. We first deploy an L1PriceOracle smart contract which receives price updates from Pyth every two seconds via a Gelato Web3 Function. This smart contract is deployed once and shared between all rollups. It verifies the associated signature to ensure the price update is legitimate and emits a PricesUpdated event containing all updated price feeds. When the rollup enters a new epoch, in addition to iterating through all deposited event logs as before, it also iterates through all PricesUpdated event logs. Just like with deposits, the rollup then constructs a special top-of-block transaction which updates prices on the L2. This top-of-block transaction calls an L2PriceOracle predeploy smart contract which stores prices on-chain and exposes them via a Pyth-like interface.\n\nIn summary, prices are pushed to and verified by a single smart contract living on the L1. On every epoch, rollups essentially copy fresh prices from L1 to L2 during derivation. Since publishing & verification is done in a single place rather than by each rollup individually, we reduce the complexity of publishing & verification from O(n) to O(1). However, despite avoiding duplicate computation, publishing prices to an L1 such as Ethereum every two seconds is prohibitively expensive. Instead, prices are published to a cheaper L2, in our case Base, and consumed by 1-Click (Base) L3 rollups. Unlike traditional oracles, 1-Click Oracles actually perform better at scale since the costs of publishing & verifying the data is amortized between all rollups. In essence, the constant cost is divided between many rollups (1/N). In addition, whenever a price feed is introduced on the Hub (Base), it is instantly available on all 1-Click rollups without any additional work. This allows us to rapidly introduce new price feeds. For more detailed information, please read the documentation.",

This allows OP-Chains to develop, test, and verify changes independently, without the need to continuously monitor L1 changes.\n\nThe local deployment capabilities of our package enable rapid feedback cycles during development, while the built-in multi-client support ensures interoperability across different clients. We have collaborated with the op-reth, op-erigon, and op-nethermind node teams to verify and fix bugs using the Optimism package.\n",

          "description": "We are a team of DevOps engineers at the Ethereum Foundation dedicated to coordinating and testing Ethereum protocol upgrades. Our mission is to build reusable tools for the entire ecosystem, with a focus on enhancing the deployment and testing stack of Ethereum. We manage the deployment, maintenance, and testing of upcoming upgrades through devnets, working closely with Ethereum client teams to identify and resolve bugs.\n\nIn addition to testing, we actively collect and monitor data from the Ethereum mainnet and testnets to detect anomalies and gain research insights. This data stack provides valuable insights into the network’s state and lays the groundwork for future, data-driven upgrades.\n\nRecently, we have expanded our efforts to include Layer 2 (L2) support for the automation tools we use on L1. This initiative aims to facilitate easier interoperability and accelerate testing processes.",

Devnets are fully-fledged Ethereum networks that we use for testing new features. We have infrastructure tooling that makes it possible to run a local devnet on your machine. For more intricate tests and networks, we also provide tools to deploy nodes across multiple remote servers. All of these networks come with tools to analyze, test, and debug them.

We manage the deployment, maintenance, and testing of upcoming upgrades through devnets, working closely with Ethereum client teams to identify and resolve bugs.\n\nIn addition to testing, we actively collect and monitor data from the Ethereum mainnet and testnets to detect anomalies and gain research insights. This data stack provides valuable insights into the network’s state and lays the groundwork for future, data-driven upgrades.\n\nRecently, we have expanded our efforts to include Layer 2 (L2) support for the automation tools we use on L1. This initiative aims to facilitate easier interoperability and accelerate testing processes.",

This improved user experience not only benefits individual users but also contributes to the overall growth and adoption of OP Stack-based platforms.\n\nTo date, rhinofi has achieved the following in regards to the OP Stack ecosystem:\n\n- 7 chains supported - OP Mainnet, Base, Mode, Blast, Zircuit, Mantle, opBNB\n- Total bridged volume on OP Stack chains - $810mio+\n- Total TX on OP Stack chains - 1,7mio+\n- Total User bridged from/to OP Stack chains - 1,3mio+\n- OP Stack campaign - https://rhino.fi/rhino-summer/",

The absence of rhinofi would not only diminish the potential for new liquidity to flow in from non-OP Stack chains but also reduce the fluidity and ease of movement of liquidity across the OP Stack chain.\n\nMoreover, a reduction in available bridging routes to the OP Stack - following a hypothetical decommissioning of rhinofi - would lead to an increased reliance on a smaller number of bridge partners, potentially concentrating risks among fewer actors. Such a scenario could make the ecosystem more vulnerable to disruptions and limit the diversity of options for users seeking to interact with OP Stack chains.",

People can send tokens to their NFC tag and tap to pay at a series of whitelisted stations (to avoid abuse).\n\nIt allows you to do simple transactions in stablecoins or any other token. It can be used at events to manage payments and to allocate finite resources to make sure that these are distributed fairly (e.g. swag). It could also be used as a way to reward people (e.g. earn tokens by doing some positive actions at the event, tap your wristband to receive the tokens).

Inherently the Superchain benefits from an improved and resilient settlement layer, i.e. Ethereum.\n\nThere are particular research topics which support the OP Stack, such as PBS research. In today’s block production process on L1, trusted ‘relays’ are part of the vast majority of all blocks produced. Our work on ePBS works towards removing this trust assumption. Fewer trust assumptions on Ethereum are also inherited by the Superchain, e.g. forced transaction inclusion. PBS research is also relevant to the OP Stack, who may [borrow](https://x.com/tyneslol/status/1813672789112737954) its concepts for the decentralization of their sequencer.\n",

This property is directly relevant to OP Chains, e.g. the guaranteed ability to force a transaction’s inclusion on OP mainnet by sending a transaction on Ethereum, or the ability to force the inclusion of a fraud proof on L1.\n\n**Timing games.** At the limit, timing games are harmful for the stability of consensus formation, especially if proposer timing games spiral into attester timing games. Thus, our work helps to maintain reliable consensus formation of Ethereum, the Superchain’s settlement layer.\n\n**Staking economics.** Our work towards maintaining a healthy staking environment, both in its composition and overall staking levels, helps to sustain important properties of a good settlement layer.",

      "description": "The Robust Incentives Group is an Ethereum Foundation research team dedicated to the study of protocol mechanisms through the lens of game theory, mechanism design, crypto-economics, formal methods and data science. \n\nOver the past year, we have significantly contributed to a broad array of discussions on improving Ethereum’s core protocol, such as the decentralization of its staking set, its ability to enforce and defend its neutrality, as well as to preserve its security.\n\nWe briefly introduce our main research directions from the past year.\n\nCensorship resistance. We are developing mechanisms to ensure the L1 protocol maintains chain neutrality by empowering Ethereum’s decentralized set of validators to enforce the inclusion of transactions in Ethereum blocks through inclusion lists (ILs). Over the past year, we have explored the design space and made significant progress towards a proposal called Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL), which we believe could be considered for inclusion in a future Ethereum upgrade. We have also collaborated with the Commit-Boost effort to develop out-of-protocol inclusion lists bridging the gap until a protocol solution is available.\n\nTiming games. Nearly a year ago, we named and introduced the concept of timing games in a publication, describing how proposers have an incentive to wait until the last moment to propose their blocks in order to maximize MEV rewards. Since then, we have observed timing games occurring in practice and have been working on mitigation strategies to maintain consensus stability. Timing games were central to critical discussions by the Ethereum research and builder communities over the last year.\n\nPBS. Our group has been at the forefront of PBS research for more than two years now. During the time period considered for this retroactive funding, we have deepened our understanding of the practice of PBS with research supporting EIP-7732 (“Enshrined Proposer–Builder Separation”). We have also been active in exploring MEV burn mechanisms, as well as the newer idea of “Attester–Proposer Separation”, with posts and publications.\n\nStaking economics. This group put forward the idea of rainbow staking dealing with an ever-changing staking landscape. It intends to embrace the heterogeneity of Ethereum's staking set and foresees different roles for different types of participants. Separately but related, this group has proposed changes to Ethereum's issuance policy in order to maintain a healthy staking level that is long-term sustainable. \n\nIf any of this catches your attention, please take a look at rig.ethereum.org to find links to all resources.",

Moreover, the sequencer operators will be able to claim immunity from front-running and censoring transactions by design, while retaining their ability to collect and/or distribute back-running related MEV.\n\nDecentralized Sequencer and MEVA designs are largely orthogonal to this proposal and complement it well.\n",

We aim to provide a solution for front-running prevention and real-time censorship resistance through transaction encryption using threshold cryptography-based distributed key generation (DKG). An encrypted mempool prevents the parts of MEV that are considered malicious (front-running, sandwich attacks) while leaving the distribution of the benign types of MEV (arbitrage, liquidations).\n\nShutter performed a feasibility study for Front-running protection via shielded mempool for the OP Stack using threshold encryption (https://gov.optimism.io/t/shutterized-optimism-an-encrypted-mempool-for-the-op-stack/). The resulting document serves as a requirements and technical architecture document for a threshold encryption-based front-running protection mechanism for the OP Stack and Bedrock codebase, capitalizing on the capabilities of the Shutter Network.",

          "description": "This document serves as a requirements and technical architecture document for a threshold encryption-based front-running protection mechanism for the OP Stack and Bedrock codebase, capitalizing on the capabilities of the Shutter Network. The mechanism targets the reduction of front-running and MEV-related exploits in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem by adopting a shielded mempool using threshold encryption.\n\nBy integrating this mechanism, we foresee OP Stack-based rollups becoming more secure and efficient layers, attracting safer trading for DeFi users, more robust censorship resistance, and increased profitability. Moreover, the sequencer operators will be able to claim immunity from front-running and censoring transactions by design, while retaining their ability to collect and/or distribute back-running related MEV.\n\nDecentralized Sequencer and MEVA designs are largely orthogonal to this proposal and complement it well.\n\nTable of Contents\n1.

Performance optimizations I’ve implemented may no longer be up-to-date, leading to increased latency and reduced efficiency. Bug fixes that enhance the stability of the ecosystem would no longer be maintained, potentially reintroducing critical vulnerabilities or operational issues. Furthermore, the absence of new features could stifle innovation and limit the OP Stack’s ability to adapt to emerging needs and technologies. In essence, my continued involvement ensures a smoother, more secure, and forward-looking OP Stack.",

Since 2018, I have been involved in various projects within the Ethereum ecosystem. During that time, I created a Chinese guide called [Hitchhikers-guide-to-the-Ethereum](https://github.com/jsvisa/Hitchhikers-guide-to-the-Ethereum), which serves as a valuable resource for beginners to understand the inner workings of Ethereum using the [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) implementation. This guide covers a wide range of topics about Ethereum, transactions, smart contracts, data structures, wallets, block synchronization, state synchronization, miners, consensus, RPC, and P2P protocols.\n\nOver the past 6 years, I've made significant contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem, including the following:\n\n- go-ethereum: merged 119 PRs\n- reth: merged 79 PRs\n- prysm: merged 11 PRs\n- erigon: merged 9 PRs\n- others: merged 21 Prs\n",

It will not be easy to claim a spot on the canvas, it will require winning multiple voting rounds and convincing the community you are the right fit for that spot. But once you do, your work will be there forever. \n\nFor people that love art, it will be a new way to interact with it. Not only being able to decide how the canvas should move forward by voting, they'll also be able to buy their favorite pieces of the canvas to gift to their friends or family or keep for themselves.\n\nThe OP stack will have a new innovative way to display it's strength, this time not rooted in DeFi. I feel a lot of people are not yet comfortable with blockchain and/or DeFi and because of that they aren't using the OP stack yet. With this project the OP stack will be able to show how a blockchain can be used to keep track of ownership of the first infinite art canvas. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It is a blank infinite art canvas that invites graphic artists from around the world to contribute and collaborate with each other to create something that has never been done before. An artwork that is never finished, an artwork that is always growing into something bigger. An artwork that evolves as time goes by. \n\nI imagine it as a digital \"cave painting\"... A place where you can see art, the artists and life merge into something that will be forever available to mankind.\n\nDo you have what it takes to Be Part Of Art? \n\nIn this first stage of the project I'd like to do a bit more research about the technical requirements and technical feasibility of the project. Find the initial group of artists to create the first piece and spend time planning the next phases. \n\nI'd like to spend some time brainstorming with different artists to see how they feel about the project and if they would want to collaborate. Since this all takes time I'd like to request an initial capital to cover the costs so I can focus on this project and the research full-time. ",

      "description": "Runtime Verification has been at the forefront of open-source formal verification tools for more than a decade. Our generalistic approach allows us to use our technology on multiple blockchains. While KEVM offers our verification infrastructure to all EVM-based smart contracts, Kontrol greatly reduces the barrier to entry to formal verification for Solidity smart contracts.\nOur tooling is completely open source and freely accessible to all developers of the Optimism ecosystem at no additional cost.\n\nKEVM is an EVM executable formal semantics written in the K framework. KEVM passes all Ethereum conformance tests and is the entry point for formally verifying smart contracts with the K framework. However, using plain KEVM requires ad-hoc training on the K framework to write specifications. Additionally, these specifications can be quite verbose, increasing the difficulty of writing them.\n\nKontrol solves this by allowing developers to write the formal specification of their smart contracts directly as Foundry property tests. These tests are automatically translated into KEVM specifications, keeping all the verification guarantees whilst allowing for a much more easy developer experience.",

The GossipSub protocol, which is part of the libp2p framework, is used for broadcasting blocks and managing topics on the network to improve latency and bandwidth efficiency. This helps nodes to share information such as blocks and messages more effectively, a critical component of Optimism’s rollup architecture.\n\nMoreover, the OP mainnet specifically uses the Go implementation of libp2p for its networking stack, demonstrating the framework's integration and importance in maintaining secure, decentralized communication within Optimism's ecosystem.",

We aren't just strengthening the network but helping devs continue their edudaction\n- Third priority is building the distributed RPC and transaction service\n\nHere are the components we've built so far:\n\n- **Bootstrap Script**: We have created a bootstrap script, a one-liner command that users can paste into their terminal to clone and run the BuidlGuidl client. It is publicly available here: nodes.buidlguidl.com This script simplifies the setup process for new node operators. The code for this script is publicly available here: https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/buidlguidl-client\n\n- **BuidlGuidl Client**: We've developed a preliminary version of the BuidlGuidl client that can spin up both Execution Layer (EL) and Consensus Layer (CL) nodes. This client also includes an RPC proxy that checks in with our central hub. You can check out the initial code here: https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/buidlguidl-client\nWhile these components are functional, they are still in undergoing continuous improvement. Our focus now is on refining these tools and expanding their capabilities to ensure reliable performance and ease of use for the community.\n\n- **Proxy Server**: We have set up an initial version of our proxy server (rpc.buidlguidl.com), which will act as the hub for our distributed RPC system.",

We build tools and educational content to teach the next wave of builders how/what they can build on Ethereum / EVMs.\n\n- **Tooling**: We built and actively maintain [🏗 Scaffold-ETH-2](https://scaffoldeth.io/), an open-source toolkit which allows for rapid prototyping and full scale dApp development on Ethereum.  \nWe have also lots of handy tools (OSS) created with SE-2 by our community, like [Abi.Ninja](https://abi.ninja/), [Hacked Wallet Recovery,](https://hackedwalletrecovery.com/) [address.vision](http://address.vision) and others.\n\n- **Education**: We provide a free curriculum at 🏃‍♀️ SpeedRunEthereum.com. A hands on, guided series of challenges to learn how to code and deploy smart contracts all while receiving the assistance of our community. \nWe also conduct monthly batches with developers who have just finished SRE, in which we encourage teamwork and collaboration among them, developing a group project.\nAlso lots of content in youtube, like BG Labs, Web2 to Web3, BG Episodes, among other video series, and IRL talks and workshops in ETH Global, Edcon and other events.\n\n- **Small Grants** We have different funding mechanisms to support high-impact devs, like BuidlGuidl streams, Cohort Streams towards a common objective, Ecosystem impact grants and BG Community Grants.",

      "description": "The Consensus R&D team focuses on both short and long-term research and development projects that aim to improve Ethereum’s security, sustainability, and scalability while retaining strong decentralization. This includes proof-of-stake consensus design, crypto-economic mechanism design, software simulations and experiments, spec writing, security assessments, testing, and more.\n\nHere are some of the projects and research directions that we have been involved with over the period covered by this RPGF round:\n\n- Inclusion lists: in the first half of 2024, an existing inclusion list proposal has been refined together with client teams, culminating in [EIP-7547](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7547), which was for a time considered for inclusion in Electra. Though that has not transpired, the work on EIP-7547 has still informed our understanding of the inclusion list design space. Eventually, this work has led to further research on more distributed inclusion list mechanisms, such as [FOCIL](https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870)\n\n- MaxEB: our team has greatly contributed to the development of the MaxEB proposal, both with [early research and security analysis](https://notes.ethereum.org/nHqON5l7SACkL_nPwz8Vqw) and with spec development. This has led to [EIP-7251](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7251), which has been included in the Electra fork. The MaxEB spec has meanwhile been incorporated in the [Electra spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/specs/electra).\n\n- PeerDAS: research, spec writing and coordination of the development effort. Starting from last fall, many research posts have been written on the topic, culminating in the [PeerDAS spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/specs/_features/eip7594) as a feature in the Ethereum consensus specifications, and with the corresponding [EIP-7594](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7594) being considered for inclusion in the next fork. \n\n- Consensus protocol research: much research work has gone into the topic of Single Slot Finality, with papers, [ethresearch posts](https://ethresear.ch/t/orbit-ssf-solo-staking-friendly-validator-set-management-for-ssf/19928), a [wip high-level spec](https://github.com/fradamt/ssf) being worked on, among other things. \n\n- Staking economics: our team actively participates in research around staking economics and generally the future of staking.\n\n",

Drippie allows for conditional, automated execution of smart contract calls, referred to as \"drips.\" These can be triggered based on specific conditions (called \"dripchecks\") and executed at set intervals. Drips can also transfer ETH, making the system useful for maintaining sufficient balances in addresses. The review specifically focused on ensuring the security of the system without reliance on external automation services, thus compartmentalizing trust assumptions.\n\nFindings:\n\n    Medium Risk:\n        Permitting Multiple Drip Calls Per Block: This vulnerability could potentially allow multiple drips to be executed within the same block, which was flagged as a security risk.\n\n    Low Risk:\n        Version Bump to Latest: The code was using outdated versions, and upgrading was recommended.\n        DoS from External Calls in Drippie.executable / Drippie.drip: External calls could be used to perform a denial-of-service attack.\n        Use call.value over transfer in withdrawETH: For better handling of ETH transfers, the use of call.value was recommended over transfer.\n        Input Validation Checks for Drippie.create: The lack of proper input validation could lead to unexpected behaviors.\n        Ownership Initialization and Transfer Safety in setOwner: Recommendations were made to improve safety checks when initializing and transferring ownership.\n        Unchecked Return and Handling of Non-standard Tokens in AssetReceiver: The contract didn’t adequately handle non-standard token behaviors.",

Since then, hundreds of OP Stack chains have launched on our rollup platform, with more than 200 currently running across testnet and mainnet. \n\nOur team works very closely with stakeholders in the Optimism ecosystem. Our team members have made multiple contributions directly to the Optimism codebase, finding various fixes and suggesting improvements.\n\nWe invest countless hours testing Beta features like custom gas tokens, Alt-DA mode, and L3s. We also spend a lot of time testing and speccing network upgrades and hard forks like Ecotone, Fjord, and the upcoming Granite fork.\n\nMore than 1/3 of the rollups in the OP Superchain use Conduit to deploy, operate, and maintain their OP Stack chain. We were one of the earliest infrastructure supporters of the OP Stack and Superchain and we're excited to bring hundreds and thousands of more chains into the ecosystem!",

In 2023, the cost barriers of running a rollup were incredibly high. In some cases, rollups were paying double-digit amounts of ETH per month just to operate. In January of this year, we migrated multiple OP Stack rollups to Celestia DA, lowering their DA costs by 100x. This dramatically lowered the barriers to entry for launching and operating OP Stack chains. Now, the Alt-DA mode standard is a key differentiator for the OP Stack, as chain operators can decide between multiple DA solutions based on their budget and needs.",

As the recipient of a mission grant, Immunefi used funds provided by OP to create a matching payout program, meaning OP protocols that opted in to the program could have their payouts to security researchers matched by OP. This has resulted in a reduction of operating costs to OP protocols, strengthened code, growth in the security researcher community focused on OP, and increased education of best security practices in web3. Immunefi publishes (with customer consent) reports after bugs are identified, that are available for all builders in the OP ecosystem to leverage when building security-minded projects. ",

Pika Protocol is another beneficiary, as they received 5,772.3 tokens to subsidize 5 critical/high valid bug payouts. Additional OP projects that have live bug bounty programs on Immunefi include: Extra Finance, Perpetual, Beethoven X, dHedge, Yearn Finance, Idle, Aevo, Exactly, Vesper and Metronome Synth. In total there are ~24 OP-related projects protected by Immunefi's crowd security bug bounty platform. These protocols mutually benefit from Immunefi's work on the OP stack because results from valid bug reports are made available to them, enabling them to learn of potential attack vectors missed during traditional audits. Immunefi hopes to continue to assist smaller OP projects by partially subsidizing their critical and high bug bounty payouts.",

We try to make the bug bounty program accessible for projects of all shapes and sizes. We offer additional services that increase price based on projects' stated needs. We leverage a network of around 45,000 security researchers from around the world to provide \"Crowd Security\" resulting in always-on coverage for projects that care deeply about security. Another is our Invite Only Program, which taps a select group of Security Researchers based on our Hacker Sync algorithm, in order to provide the best talent specific to a projects codebase, for a security audit (ideal for closed source projects). Finally, Immunefi offers audit competitions which are time-bound audits that leverage our network of security researchers to hunt for bugs in order to unlock rewards. For audit competitions we take a percentage of the prize pool ranging from 20-27.5% based on parameters set by the customer. Immunefi's products offer incredible ROI whether a project is bootstrapped in testnet or established with millions in TVL. ",

Now, as part of the [core features available](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/chain-operators/features/bridged-usdc-standard) to OP Stack Chain Operators, anyone can deploy a Bridged USDC version, which includes:\n\n- A factory implementation for one-click deployment on Ethereum and targeted OP Stack Chain.\n- A seamless migration flow for tokens, in this case, to native USDC, in coordination with Circle.\n- The ability to claim funds after the migration process is completed as well as other edge cases.\n\nThis referenced implementation also contributes to the development of custom token bridges for OP Stack Chains, particularly for those interested in the flows introduced.",

Delta is effective for low-active chains, but active chains, such as Zora, are saving up to 30% of fixed L1 costs with Span Batches.\n\nFor the Superchain’s success, reducing the fixed on-chain cost is important.

      "description": "OP Erigon is the first alternative execution client implemented to OP Stack. Test in Prod built & has been actively maintaining OP Erigon since April 2023. Since then, OP Erigon has been serving strategic use cases that require Erigon's high efficiency on disk & performance. Notable users are Blockaid, Chainstack, Blockjoy, etc. \n\nIn the Superchain’s vision, disk space is a huge problem. For example, the sum of OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora’s OP Geth archive node size is 16.16TB. On the other hand, OP Erigon only costs 3.55 TB, which is a 78% savings. Considering the challenger nodes need to run all nodes in Superchain with the interop future, leveraging OP Erigon is a huge win.\n\nSince Retro Funding round 3, Test in Prod has worked on the following:\n- Support users to run & troubleshoot OP-Erigon.\n- Update the up-to-date upstream codes.\n- Port Erigon 3, which saves 90.9% of disk footprint compared to Geth on L1.\n- Host the archive node snapshots for OP Mainnet, OP Sepolia, and Base Mainnet—350+ downloads per month.\n- Host the public RPC of OP Erigon & Otterscan, which serves 4.9k requests/day on average.\n\n---\nHere are the commentaries from the notable users: \n\nRaz (CTO of Blockaid): With OP-Erigon, Blockaid could protect users in the Optimism ecosystem (OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora) more effectively by leveraging its efficient disk space and performance. Moreover, working with Sunnyside Labs is a smooth experience—they help us troubleshoot, notify us of upcoming network upgrades, etc. We think their works are impactful, at least for us. \n\nEugene (CTO of Chainstack): Chainstack is using op-erigon for Global Elastic Nodes in OP Mainnet & Base. Thanks to op-erigon, we could run the archive nodes for the Optimism ecosystem more efficiently. Test in Prod was also helpful for the node operations by helping us troubleshoot, alerting us for upcoming upgrades, etc.\n\nChris (CEO of Blockjoy): Blockjoy provides dedicated unmetered op-erigon node services for customers needing high performance Erigon RPCs; notable customers are Trueblocks, Blockaid, etc. Operating nodes as efficiently as possible can require true expertise, this is why we enjoy working with Test in Prod & hope to continue working with them in the future!",

We estimate that in 3 months after MVP we will have around 1,500 active users of the service and over 16,000 transactions per month. We will attract more than 80,000 customers who will make more than 2,000,000 transactions every month by the end of 2027, we plan to grow by 40% per month. \nWe plan to actively engage the community to increase the TVL of our platform and blockchain in the next release. Our strategy involves raising a minimum of 5 million from the community. These funds will be directed to the mass purchase of cars. We believe that group investment is a more affordable and efficient way to get a car. For example, one person cannot always afford to buy a car for 100,000, but a thousand people united by our service can easily collect the required amount.",

Rentality is a project from the direction of RWA (Real World Assets), which offers car rental and tokenization services. Our experience allows us to build a new trend in web3 - the transformation of RWS (Real Word Services) services, which will later become a benchmark for the entire web3 direction. The entire web3 community gets access to the convenient services they are usually using web2, thereby bringing web3 closer to mass adoption. We eliminate intermediaries between the guest and the host, creating a fair price for the community.\nExample\nWhen booking a car on web2, both the guest and the host pay for the services and commissions of various intermediaries, from Google and financial institutions to Turo, which operates with an inefficient monopoly structure. These commissions significantly affect the price of the product. ",
