The purpose is to attract enough TVL in the vault that makes deployments into these Superchain strategies feasible. At the same time, Lido contributors will also explore other co-incentivization options with the protocols (and chains where relevant) that are included in the vault strategies to further drive growth."

From the Final Milestone: With the remaining portion of the grant + matched Hydrex incentives, we have a budget of $39,000 to work with. We would more conservatively distribute these rewards over the next 8 weeks until end of year to sustain acquired TVL and encourage new TVL at lower rates."

These co-incentives represent approximately 33% of the OP distributed to our users on Base. We believe this is a fair compromise that gives us the best chance of reaching our milestones and demonstrating the full impact the incentives can have. Updated: I have also updated the grant to match the request of 200k OP + $24000 USDC and the milestones to based on these changes."
