## Codebase Patterns
- Use `uv run marimo check <file>` to verify notebook syntax
- Token events data uses columns: project_name, block_timestamp, value_op, event_type
- event_type is 'inflow' or 'outflow'
- Projects keyed by 'title' (display name) not 'oso_project_slug'

## 2026-01-22 - US-018
- Implemented token transfer verification logic for detecting discrepancies in grant inflows
- Added EXPECTED_FIRST_INFLOWS dict with test cases: Truemarkets (70K), Super DCA (30K), 40acres.finance (200K)
- Created verify_first_inflow() function that returns (is_valid, actual_amount, discrepancy_pct)
- Added df_token_transfers_verified DataFrame with columns: project_name, first_inflow_amount, first_inflow_date, expected_amount, is_valid, discrepancy_pct, inflow_warning
- Console output logs verification status for all test cases
- Files changed: s8-strategic-insights.py
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - marimo must be run via `uv run marimo` in this project
  - Token events DataFrame is keyed by project_name which matches 'title' from df_grants
  - The verification cell needs to be placed after fetch_token_events but exports df_token_transfers_verified and verify_first_inflow for downstream use
