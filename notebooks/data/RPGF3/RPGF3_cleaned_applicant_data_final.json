Unfortenately, the project was shut down after some time, due to lack of funding.\nOpenEthereum London hard fork discovered a critical bug in Geth client on one of the test networks just before the mainnet activation. Obviously, this prevented a serious consensus bug between geth client and the rest of the clients. London hard fork also contained the EIP1559 implementation - change in the fee mechanism for Ethereum.\nI also had contributions to rust web3 library widely used for all rust projects on ethereum and EVM compatible chains and also contributed to Cowswap project which main impact is protecting users from MEV and giving best prices.",

        "Contribution Description": "The Aestus MEV-Boost Relay is a neutral, non-censoring block relay for Ethereum proof-of-stake validators and block builders, offered to the community as a public good. We are free from any commercial interest and aligned to principles of credible neutrality.  The Aestus  project originally developed out of conversations between members of the EthFinance and EthStaker communities who saw the need to develop credibly neutral architecture for the ethereum staking ecosystem. We have been in continuous operation for approximately 1 year and contribute to security of the L1 and L2 ecosystems.",

Additionally, there are only a few ways to organically build knowledge-based reputation on chain.\n\nPonder currently solves both of these issues by deploying social surveys on Farcaster (Optimism), then rewarding respondents with reputation and tokens (Base) based upon the quality and frequency of responses. These surveys enable users to ask important questions of the community, build their personal reputation by answering, and earn rewards while they\u2019re at it.\n\nWe\u2019ve deployed over 95 surveys in 8 months, and have nearly 500 monthly active users.",

The 2021 tax season was especially bad, as token prices fell by 80-90%, leaving contributors with a hefty, surprise tax bill and reduced ability to pay.  Many contributors walked away from the space entirely.\n\nTo solve this, Taxman allows anyone to calculate their DAO income taxes in their own fiat currency in 10 minutes.

It translates IPFS URLs internally to the defined (or detected) gateway thus giving the user a smooth IPFS usage experience without them ever seeing the gateway part of a URL.\n\nThese additions to CURL make it accept the IPFS URLs without the need to prefix them with a gateway (a central point of entry).",

Ideally you want the user to specify just the IPFS parts, the gateway needs to be a configuration. The changes made in curl 8.4.0 do exactly that. Users can now use an IPFS URL like this:\ncurl ipfs://bafybeigagd5nmnn2iys2f3doro7ydrevyr2mzarwidgadawmamiteydbzi\n\nThe gateway is effectively reduced to a configuration detail. Users of curl now don't need to share the gateway anymore and can instead use plain simple IPFS URLs.\n\nCURL is estimated to be installed at ~20 billion places making this a potential huge impact for IPFS adoption and another step in a more distributed world.",

The team added support for the first non EVM-equivalent version of the OVM in 2020, and has since worked on ways to mitigate issues faced by users unaware of the differences between EVM versions on Optimism and Mainnet.\n\nVyper's design principles prioritize security and audibility.

        "Contribution Description": "We have designed and deployed a novel utility for NFTs called \"Proof-Of-Bridging\" which brings increased user adoption cross-chain. These IceBreak-R Quest Badges work by incentivizing our free-mint series on four unique layer-2s. This is an evolution of the learn-to-earn model by which users can gain participation rewards simply for bridging, minting and holding NFTs in our ecosystem. \n\nThe primary goal is to encourage exploration of emerging blockchains and networks by new users by simplifying the onboarding process and/or bridging in. By creating free-mints which also reward the users over time we have aligned the incentives for all participants to drive adoption and curiosity.",

New user have begun to explore and dig past the surface layers once they have bridged those funds, asking for new dapps and sites to connect to.\n\nThe main platform we are utilizing currently is Zora.co, whereby the users can continue to connect with other art projects, mint or have fun with NFT collections. Artists, cross-chain DeFi users and NFT collectors are all benefitting from our concepts and smart contracts by learning how to expand into new territory.

We estimate that about 385 ETH have been spent (either by apps or users\u2019 of said apps) to update the Pyth prices on-chain.

The community calls have provided a central place for updates, discussion, decision-making, and onboarding of new governance members. The additional events have filled communication needs for the community as they have surfaced. The mission pitch session allowed for a rapid display of mission proposals.

Many impactful decisions were facilitated by these calls; for example a large number of improvements to missions being implemented in Season 5 stemmed directly from community feedback on call #23. In addition, these calls have helped transition many delegates from new to active-and-contributing by being the go-to place for onboarding. The pitch session for mission proposals aided delegates in making better voting decisions for the batch of missions. The speed-networking for badgeholders fostered connection amongst a diverse group of individuals centered around Optimism.",

Furthermore, as Autonomous Worlds they are a test bed for the technical and governance structures required for a future of ownerless, composable applications.\n\nPlaymint's work on Client Side Proofs was released as a public good and shared with other teams in the space. Since the time of its release the idea of running proofs on clients has been considered a practical possibility.",

The tool kit is free and open source and able to audit mechanism design which has historically been challenging. The tool is also able to model risk across many stochastic processes and historical data. The EVM logic simulator has been used to find critical vulnerabilities in the Portfolio smart contract system that auditors were previously unable to identify. Because of the tools speed and EVM execution parity, it allows for unparalleled quality and quantity of testing data for any smart contract system or application. As optimism maintains support for the EVM execution environment and is an extensive smart contract system, tooling across to ecosystem to help improve safety and security is paramount. ",

In just three months, we've grown to over 10,000 followers, held remarkable Onchain Summer events, and received a generous 2 ETH grant from @Buildonbase. Our NFT collection sold out, establishing us as an OG collection in the Base ecosystem. We swiftly introduced .basepunk domains, granting free minting to our NFT holders.\n\nThe Base Punk Chat DApps ( which is assessable to .basepunk domain holder only) launch brought innovative features, such as minting posts as NFTs, allowing users to earn ETH and activity points, soon to convert to $bpunk tokens. We also unveiled a token send feature for seamless transactions.\n\nWith these milestones, Base Punk is reshaping the NFT space and leading the way in Web3 innovation.",

We decided to make it part of our mandate to teach our 20,000+ followers about the benefits of using OP chains, & show them how to do it.\n\nWe migrated our daily edition collection \"NOMO Nouns\" from mainnet to OP, started minting our podcasts as FREE mints on Zora L2 & are launching a DAO on BASE L2 using Nouns Builder.

But unlike a regular online content house, as an onchain collective we have been able to leverage the OP stack in our core infrastructure so that we're not only talking the talk, but walking the walk! Not only have we produced high quality videos, panels & podcasts about Optimism, Zora & BASE, but we have also taken steps to involve our community in actually using these networks to mint our content and our community NFT collections. People learn best by doing, and we are putting that to the test every day.",

To this extent, monthly more than 11750 users on the site find grant programs that could benefit their project.\n\nA few of the startups that we have advised have also gained grants from OP. For example Robo labs was one of the projects we referred to apply for OP grants.\n\nThe voluntary nature of the project and no fee involved means we can only dedicate limited resources to our efforts. Hence we never properly documented the number of projects that have secured grants directly or indirectly through help from Web3 Native.\n\nOur accelerator and VC lists provide projects with additional options to get support when grants might not be the best route to get funding.",

I helped to design the strategy for launch, the token NFTE, the airdrop campaign, build the team, deploy the marketplace contracts (we cloned OpenSea Seaport in the first iteration) and get the marketplace up and running in ~40 days. There were several competing teams in early 2023 vying to launch a Quix replacement - a badly needed solution, but only 2 teams actually ever did launch (NFTEarth and Zonic). The team also built the only self-hosted Indexer from Reservoirs open-source repository. NFTEarth code can be seen on the GitHub profile link provided.",

This enabled them to discover the ecosystem and understand how it works, as well as its advantages.\n\nAfterwards, we covered a number of news items, such as the $150 million fundraising in March 2022, the airdrop in June 2022, or more technical topics like the improvements brought about by the Bedrock update. We also reported on the network's successes, with articles on the number of active addresses and the number of transactions.",

They are overwhelmed by bots after releasing a new product and can't charge a monthly fee that users are not willing to pay.\n\nCrypto micropayments have not historically been possible due to high mainnet gas costs and slow, cumbersome transaction UX. However, we use embedded wallets and ERC4337 to allow new users to sign up via SMS, fund their account, and directly pay developers every time they use the app. No seed phrases, no transaction confirmation, no gas.\n\nOn an L2 like Optimism or Base, users can try out new AI apps for cents on the dollar and developers can bootstrap a user base without going broke.",

Our open-source implementation has enabled developers to create better UX for secure self-custody on Optimism and Ethereum-equivalent L2s more broadly.\n\nP256 ECDSA signatures are available on a wide variety of consumer cryptosystems including Yubikey, Apple's Secure Enclave, the Android Keystore, passkeys, and WebAuthn. This makes P256 signature verification especially useful for smart-contract wallets, enabling hardware-based signing keys and safer, easier self-custody.\n\nSee our blog post (https://daimo.xyz/blog/p256verifier) for a more complete description of the features and under-the-hood details of the verifier.",

Thus providing better governance access for public goods funding to verified regen actors across the wider web3 ecosystem. \n\nCurrent contributions include:\n\n- Analytical model for behaviour scoring described in documentation and supported by statistical sampling\n- A website for checking out your score and minting the on-chain attestation (including a schema, with separate scoring just for OP behaviours) (open source)\n- A series of communications with the OP and web3 community for feedback and engagement over various channels",

Holonym's mission is to build open source tools for decentralized identity and secure key custody. Our focus is on digital rights, user-centric privacy controls, and transparent governance to accelerate open civics and decentralized science (DeSci). The OP ecosystem is our chosen infra to accomplish this mission.\n\nAlmost 18,000 users have added themselves to the Holonym identity mixer on the OP blockchain. Of these, over ~9000 have minted ZK SBTs proving that they are a real unique person, and not a bot. As part of this work, we've deployed smart contracts such as ZK SBT proof smart contracts, a large anonymity set, example issuers in rust, a DeSci identity registry, and privacy relayer contract.",

        "Contribution Description": "PWN is a peer-to-peer lending protocol designed for long-term mortgage-like loans of digital assets, backed by other digital assets. Borrowers can receive a fixed-duration loan of fungible tokens backed by fungible or non-fungible tokens, while lenders can earn interest by granting these loans. The protocol is trustless, and immutable.\n\nWe are strong believers that the OP stack is a main pillar of Ethereum scaling. For this reason our platform provides an opportunity on the OP stack for borrowers to get peer to peer fixed terms loans and lenders to get rewarded for lending against ERC-20s, and NFTs (and soon RWAs).\n",

Since the initial deployment of Teleport in November 2022, Maker governance has voted to change its multi-chain roadmap due to the \u201cEndgame\u201d which resulted in pausing further growth of Teleport, however it did provide an early technical improvement for Optimism users and was a pioneer in native asset burning/minting on chain.",

Thousands of DAOs have used this tooling to manage billions of USD in crypto and well known DAOs are already using it to migrate to Optimism.\n\nWe also deployed all the infrastructure needed by communities to launch the same economic model the TEC has (the ABC), without the need for a developer. Optimism is now the only network where this no-code solution can be used. \n\nMore indirectly, our open source research on Augmented Bonding Curves and Conviction Voting has been a public good for the Ethereum and web3 community. The ABC was charging mint and burn fees years before friend.tech launched with a similar mechanism. ",

For instance, users can choose Apple Pay to purchase signers when they connect their accounts to other clients built on top of Farcaster. This extends to other onchain actions such as signing up for an account, recovering an account, and paying for storage. As many teams build consumer experiences on top of the Superchain ecosystem, this type of UX will be essential in onboarding the next wave of users who are new to the space and aren't as crypto-savvy.",

Web3 Talks: a podcast where top crypto founders take us on a backstage tour and explain how they built their projects. It has 48 episodes so far, incl. interviews with founders of ZORA, WalletConnect, Farcaster, Zapper, Gnosis & many more.\n\n2. Goldmine3: Listeners asked me for a way to browse through stories & tactics shared on the podcast, so I built a searchable repo of real web3 case studies.\n\n3. Product communications guide: As I've spoken with 100+ crypto founders, I found they find it hard to explain what their products do. So I wrote a guide with 40 examples of good & bad practices.\n\n4. GoerliETH: I distributed ca. 30,000 GoerliETH",

So I open-sourced it.\n\nSince the podcast is focused on niche, tactical know-how, it only had a bit more than 1,500 subscribers. My guide also had a bit more than 1,000 readers.

It connects to an Ethereum source, parses blocks, transactions, and logs and maps data onto PG tables. A single E2PG can index events across many L2s into a single Postgres database. E2PG connects to Ethereum by 1 of 3 ways: JSON RPC API, full node file system (fast), or using RLPS (slower than full node but faster than JSON RPC).\n\nRLPS is an HTTP API that delivers compressed RLP data for: blocks, transactions, and logs designed specifically for indexers. Index Supply hosted RLPS runs on many chains including the following OP L2s: 10, 420, 8453, and 84531. Index Supply operates a full nodes (op-geth, op-node) for each hosted RLPS API.",

Since then we've made it dead simple to boot up an E2PG indexer and have it be connected to Optimism and Base to start indexing data across those chains. To my knowledge, E2PG + RLPS is the quickest way to get data from multiple L2 chains into a Postgres database.

I think Optimism is very aligned with Ethereum decentralization values so I find a lot value and potential on the Optimism tech and culture. That's why I made the following contributions to the Optimism Collective:\n\n1. OP Stack documentation guides\n2. OP Stack developer content in livestream, article and video format\n3. Developer, artist and user onboarding to OP Mainnet\n4. Smart contract development on OP Mainnet for in-person events in local community, at San Pedro Sula, Honduras\n\n* Note: My contributions listed here are RPGF3 only.

Our unique architecture allows users to receive funds in less time and at a lower cost than many other bridges connected to Optimism, including the Optimism canonical bridge. We are also the largest 3rd party bridge in the Optimism ecosystem to use an optimistic settlement mechanism. Across is secured by UMA's Optimistic Oracle, and has withstood multiple attempted attacks without missing a beat. \n\nThe Across DAO also recently voted on Optimism as the second hub for our ACX token. This has led to nearly $500k in sticky TVL migrating to this pool in Velodrome:\nhttps://velodrome.finance/liquidity?query=ac  ",

        "Impact Description": "Providing one of the first examples of hardware signing on OP Stack drew the community's attention toward Optimism. The popular thread received not only 600K views but also got RT support from nearly 500 individuals.\n\nAfter the development of Opclave, Renaud from the Ledger team conducted a study and published an article aimed at reducing the gas fee costs of the 'verifier' contract. This article prompted the entire ecosystem to examine the usage of secp256r1 in OP Stack. \n\nAt a time when there were very few projects utilizing OP Stack technology, Opclave emerged and led the way for other projects. After Opclave, many projects worked on Hardware Signing and produced products. \n\nAll of these have contributed to increasing the awareness of Optimism Collective among even more people.",

They were tasked with exploring protocols, broadly construed, from various angles and across a range of different domains. By going broad, the researchers were able to find insights that applied in many contexts, including blockchain protocols such as Optimism and Ethereum. \n\nSome themes explored include the evolution of safety protocols, what \"protocol death\" looks like, the interplay of human agency and formulaic protocols, and more. \n\nThe output of the program is being published for all to access. The hope is for the program to help the Ethereum and Optimism communities become more \"protocol literate\" and have a better theoretical understanding of how protocols work. ",

SoP aims to give the OP Collective the tools to get better at the latter. \n\nSoP is also a way for the Ethereum community to engage with experts outside of blockchain that want to also better understand protocols for their domain of interest, and build bridges with communities we may otherwise not be able to.

        "Contribution Description": "CryptoZombies is an interactive school that teaches students to write smart contracts by making their own crypto-collectibles game. CryptoZombies was the first tutorial on the internet for NFTs and is still very relevant to the new crop of web3 developers looking to enter the industry today. The curriculum is focused on Solidity development, which also helps onboard new developers to Optimism. \n\nRecently, we've teamed up with the Optimism Foundation to build a new course, Optimism Unleashed, that teaches students to write, test, and deploy smart contracts on the OP Mainnet and use the newly released Superchain Faucet. The course is available at https://cryptozombies.io/en/optimism.\n",

Several cost saving solutions (Swarm?) alternative to the Mainnet.\nHow available is this data? Can I get a sample? Yes, forever (potentially and always).\nHow does the cost of storing this data impact the costs of the L2? It\u2019s minimal.\nWhat happens if the whole L2 goes offline but the DAC stays on? It\u2019s as good as Optimism.",

OPP was the first meme token listed on Velodrome and the project was baked by a good veVELO position accumulated thanks to its community.\nI've took the lead of the project so it can survive, with the goal of contributing to the whole Optimism ecosystem as a community project.\n\nIn that context, I've started working on the Autobribes protocol. It's goal is to act as liquidity incentivization layer that supports Velodrome by locking tokens instead of dumping. Users stake their LP on Autobribes and are rewarded with \"real yield\", while Autobribes farm and lock VELO. The real yield is obtained from bribe chasing. Two instances have been deployed on Optimism: the \"Reliquary Prime\", and \"Autobribes for Velodrome\".",

Our community consumes hundreds of sources a month to handpick and upvote top content for crypto founders & developers. From tweets, through essays, up to Dune dashboards and GitHub repos.\n\nWe a use P2P architecture - similar to Farcaster - so that most heavy data is stored offchain and only the most important elements, such as delegations & NFTs are stored onchain. The architecture promotes credible neutrality as it lets users run p2p nodes or clients with their own UI & moderation rules, such as kiwinews.lol run by our contributor, freeatnet or Kiwi News Search by matallo.\n\nWe are 100% Open Source. Our R&D on scaling ETH via the P2P protocol and OP key delegation  can be reused by others.",

So, supporting Otterscan means creating more incentives to justify the entire OP-Stack architecture.\n\nDeveloper ecosystem: explorers are a fundamental piece of software for developers to understand what's happening onchain. The market leader is a closed source product; we are opensource and able to be run on developers' machines. We also promote open datasets, like Sourcify for contract verification.\n\nSupporting Otterscan means less reliance on vendor lock-in and closed databases.",

        "Contribution Description": "I am Xofee, a mechanical artist, creating marvels like the 'Opti Maze,' 'KZG Marble Machine,' and 'Onchain Illusion,' each narrating significant blockchain milestones. \nMy project, the 'KZG Marble Machine,' was crafted for the KZG ceremony, a pivotal moment in enhancing Layer 2 capacities on Ethereum. It encapsulated the blockchain's essence, creating a useful spectacle appreciated and featured in notable podcasts like Bankless' Weekly Rollup\u2019 and the Daily Gwei.\n'Opti Maze' was a tribute to Optimism on OPcraft. 'Onchain Illusion,' created for the Onchain Summer event, symbolizes the amalgamation of art and blockchain.\nThrough the RetroPGF 3 initiative, I seek to secure support that will further fuel my quest to blend the abstract blockchain concepts with tangible mechanical artistry.",

There are over 900 unique holders of our membership NFT. Many of which were new to Optimism and had to bridge funds to mint/buy the NFT on Optimism.\n\nThere's a healthy mix of some of the best founders in DeFi in our community as well as \"retail users\" from emerging markets. One of our main missions at Cryptotesters is to bridge the gap between users and founders. We airdropped half of these membership NFTs to old community members before the mint date 2 years ago and have given many away since in order to give people from all backgrounds a chance of entering.\n",

I believe that to date, no one has written a more detailed and informative piece of content about the OP Stack than I have and my piece was well received even without ever making it into any of Optimism's feeds (which would have amplified it substantially).

        "Contribution Description": "Since Optimism launched I've onboarded a lot of people to Optimism, but didn't ever think about officially onboarding people and supporting Optimism and getting RetroPGF funds for it.\n\nMy efforts to onboard people started in 2021 via a small project called Mafia Creativa - a creative outreach and collective based on:\n-free education and onboarding into web3\n-leveraging creativity for the common good\n\nWe hosted numerous calls, twitter spaces and virtual events for crypto curious romanians. Back them public goods in web3 were synonimous with Gitcoin and Optimism so most of our calls were focused around that.\n\nIn early 2023 I created RoOptimism a twitter account that's 100% focused on onboarding and educating romanians around Optimism.",

In the future, when Op Stack networks explode, we believe that not only native Op Stack bridges, but also optimistic bridges will be indispensable. This is because optimistic bridges are currently the cheapest and fastest of all bridge types. We will continue to contribute to the Optimism ecosystem by actively bridging the Op Stack ecosystem.",

Many emerging OP-stack chains aren't supported, requiring analytics to run a full node to access the data they need to power analytics on their app or at the chain/multi-chain level.\n\nSolution: indexed.xyz\u00a0is a public, open, and CC0-licensed dataset that allows anyone to freely download, copy, and analyze chain data (incl. OP-stack chains like Zora and Base) without any restriction. By adopting a local-first approach, we enable builders to leverage their local storage and compute resources, making it easier and more affordable to work with crypto data, all while providing more flexibility and control.",

Individual contributors\nDevelopers can spin up a full block explorer connected to their local development chain in a few minutes.\nBlocks & txs are automatically synced and processed, and give detailed info to the developer. ABIs can also be synced in order to generate an UI to interact with the contract.\n2. Teams\nThrough either the UI or the API, teams can connect their hosted testnet RPC and get a full explorer accessible through a public url (can be their own domain), making easier to do internal/user testing.\n3. Appchains\nIt can be block explorer for Optimism L2s. It takes a few seconds to launch and everything is handled automatically.\nIt has an API to launch explorers on demand (especially important considering all the \"L2 as a service\" launching).",

Together, they have developed over 25 public Open Source Projects, primarily at ETH Global hackathons.\n\nThese digital solutions encompass seven categories, leveraging advanced Ethereum technologies to address cities\u00b4 challenges like transparency, efficiency, and coordination. Our main contribution is the development of over 60 Solidity contracts deployed across multiple EVMs, with \u224828% of these contracts tested on the Optimism mainnet or Op Goerli networks. This has resulted in gas fee expenditure of  .116 ETH, bridging \u224810 ETH to the OP mainnet, and locking \u22484k USD in 2 OP chains until 2026.",

It not only supports any OP-based networks, but it was also utilized in the prebedrock optimism-contracts repository itself. Despite its widespread use, TypeChain has recently been deprecated in favor of newer alternatives. This makes it perfect candidate for RPGF.\n\nDethCode offers the ability to browse smart contracts within ephemeral instances of VS Code. It supports both OP and Base networks. The innovative concept behind DC impressed Etherscan so much that they integrated similar functionality directly into their product. Nevertheless, DethCode continues to operate as a public utility, contributing to the broader ecosystem.",

This involved the following:\n\n- Changes to support that latest version of Cannon and the updated pre-image oracle\n- A docker builder image for easy cross-compilation of MIPS binaries\n- `cargo cannon` CLI tool to make it simple to bootstrap and build projects\n- Updated API for retrieving pre-image oracle data that is safer and more rust idiomatic\n\nCannon-rs is currently used by ChainSafe Systems and Sygma to develop production applications that use Cannon and the OP stack.",

The deployment of this infrastructure builds upon $59m of onchain impact by removing on and off-ramping barriers for nonprofits to accept any asset digital or otherwise. We've deployed 7000+ contract addresses on Base and OP respectively, representing every verified nonprofit in our database on both chains.We have seen 405 donations from 339 unique wallets to 78 organisations. Donations enable quadratic matching from the Universal Impact Pool with each new recipient earning funding from this activity.",

        "Impact Description": "Our goal is to streamline the full-stack web3 application development process. In our experience, building a full-stack application is often a mess that leaves developers juggling dependencies, SDKs, and APIs. \n\nTurboETH helps application developers by making it extremely easy to add a new decentralized protocol or web3 service to your app. Over the course of this year, we\u2019ve created a go-to destination for builders who want to make the jump from smart contracts to full-stack applications. And with ~80% of our builders being new to crypto or more junior developers, we believe that TurboETH is not only increasing the number of active builders in the Optimism Collective, but also helping to retain developers in their transition from launching contracts to building applications.",

It's used to hold delegates accountable, improve visibility and help tokenholders discover candidates.\n\n2. Onchain DAO Delegate Registry - Delegate info is scattered across different gov. frontends. To solve this, we built an onchain registry of delegates on Optimism to store all delegate info. \n\n3. Karma GAP (Grantee Accountability Protocol) - It's difficult for community to keep track of grantees and their progress. We built protocol on Optimism+EAS to help grantees post updates, hold them accountable and build rep. ",

We're collaborating with Bored Town for .town domain adoption.\n\nOpti.domains represents a breakthrough in ENS technology, being the first to integrate domain names with Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) systems.\n\nAll of our domain name holders are HIGH-QUALITY users since they are required to link their Twitter and Discord to mint the domain name. These connections are attested publicly on EAS.\n\nULTIMATELY, WE'RE THE FIRST TO OFFER PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE WEB3 WALLET <-> WEB2 SOCIAL PROFILE CONNECTION DATA, OPEN FOR PERMISSIONLESS QUERYING!\n\nLastly, we have contributed to the adoption of ENS on the Layer 2 standard by forking and making contributions to core libraries.",

It also uses several core infrastructure components (client implementations, specifications, test suites, etc.) developed and maintained by Protocol Guild contributors over the years. Optimism also directly benefits from protocol upgrades such as proto-danksharding (EIP-4844), which will reduce the fees its users need to pay.\n\nAll of this work supports a mutual relationship;\n- Ethereum provides an infrastructural foundation with particular characteristics (eg social, political, technical, economic) that only it can provide\n- Optimism produces lower-cost blockspace, while still inheriting some of Ethereum's characteristics, but at the same time allowing for more experimentation",

Supporting Ethereum from early years to PoS migration, optimistic rollups are no stranger to the values that have helped the Ethereum ecosystem, and Dappnode has recently added Optimism to its Rollups menu, a dashboard that lets you easily run a node.

My plan is to extend the knowledge that I share on web3ma.de to add more value = impact. \n\nAdditionally, I act as a delegate and currently represent 58 addresses. By regularly voting on proposals, I believe I contribute to the health and robustness of OP's governance. I do this because I believe in Optimism, not because I'm trying to get a grant :) ",

I built an OpenSource tool to navigate the Farcaster community with plain-english prompts. You can ask Findcaster things like \"Find me people who are interested in AI\" and then connect with them through some of the Farcaster existing clients. Next steps I want to take with the projects are around becoming an actual client as well, allowing people to connect with their Farcaster account and contact people directly through my tool, or maybe with XMTP. Another interesting thing to explore is to offer this service as an API or SDK that other applications can use to offer a smart user search to their users/customers.",

This significant accomplishment was made possible through the implementation of ENS wildcard resolution. Our application has already empowered ENS name holders to seamlessly connect their names/domains with the contract addresses of NFT collections, resulting in the automatic provision of free subdomains linked to individual token IDs.\n\nAs a real-world example, consider the OptiChads collection. Every Chad owner automatically received an ENS subdomain under optichads.eth, precisely corresponding to the token ID of their NFT. For instance, the subdomain 69.optichads.eth, directly resolves to the address of the individual who owns Chad #69. ",

It uses a single well-documented config file.\n\nAdditionally, it supports EIP-4337 AA infrastructure (bundler + paymaster) and helps you automatically subsidize gas for transactions that match certain criteria.\n\nSpinning a rollup on Goerli is as simple as:\n\n> git clone git@github.com:0xFableOrg/roll-op.git\n> cd roll-op\n> cp conf.toml.example conf.toml\n# conf.toml: uncomment Goerli section, add your keys & rpc\n> ./rollop setup --yes\n> ./rollop --preset=prod --conf=conf.toml l2\n\nMore info: https://twitter.com/norswap/status/1707188816455622899",

        "Contribution Description": "Flexible Voting is an extension to the widely used OpenZeppelin Governor that enables novel DAO voting schemes to be created. Flexible Voting is developed and maintained by ScopeLift.\n\nFor a DAO that adopts it, the Flexible Voting extension allows delegates to split their voting weight across For/Against/Abstain options for a given proposal. This new building block allows arbitrary delegate contracts to be developed which can unlock all kinds of new use cases. Of particular relevance to Optimism is the ability to vote with tokens bridged to L2, a use case ScopeLift is currently building.\n\nIt also enables other use cases like Voting with tokens while earning yield in DeFi, shielded voting (i.e. secret/private voting), liquid delegation and more.",

Notably, Gitcoin runs Grants Rounds on Optimism, and has just launched their own OP Stack network (PGN), and PoolTogether just launched version 5 of their protocol on Optimism first.\n\nScopeLift is actively building a solution to cross chain voting, i.e. enable token holders for these DAOs (and future adopters of Flexible Voting), to bridge their tokens off mainnet and vote with them. The first network we are targeting for this product is Optimism. Within the next few months, we expect to go live, allowing token holders for these DAOs to bridge and vote from Optimism. ",

We had three different projects that use the OP stack to build: Mantle, Metis and Goshen. Each provided tons of insights about why they chose Optimism, and encouraged listeners to start building on OP.",

As onchain SVGs, this animated art can be code-inspected, copied and riffed on\n\nMost importantly, the art and the description text present the work and the chains they're  deployed on as territory for wholesome enthusiasm, onchain creativity, and a positive message to builders and minters: You got this! You can do it! Go get it! Stay optimistic!",

The system provides badges based on user interactions such as voting in DAOs, swapping or lending coins/NFTs, etc. Users can collect badges to improve their on-chain reputation and build their EtherScore profile. On top of this, Dapps can develop services that require a reputation system, such as curated social networks, fair airdrops/ICOs, DeFi, DAO governance etc. Chainlink and The Graph are used for decentralization and verifiability of our solution.\n\nThe alpha version of EtherScore is live on Mumbai testnet and offers more than 80 badges for users of the most popular Dapps and chains. Of these 80 badges, 13 are related to the Optimism ecosystem, cumulating to 120,000 mints (details in the Impact section).",

        "Impact Description": "BMX by Morphex launched on BASE in September, 2023. Since then, we have onboarded 550+ users, almost $500k liquidity in BLT, and $330k+ in wBLT. Trading volume has surpassed $4.7mm+ with over $8k+ in revenue. wBLT-(OtherAsset) liquidity pools have surpassed $530k+ TVL. Liquidity providers of protocols like Yearn Finance and Ethos Reserve have deployed wBLT-YFI and wBLT-stERN liquidity pools on Velocimeter. Instead of pairing wETH-YFI or USDC-stERN, wBLT allows bluechip capital to be put to work and earn additional revenue for the LP/protocol in addition to pool2 rewards. wBLT as a paired asset composed of multiple bluechips and stablecoins may also reduce single-asset price volatility risk. The features of BMX by Morphex and use-cases of wBLT introduce unique reasons to bridge to BASE.",

Seamless opens up a new form of borrowing\u2014integrated liquidity markets\u2014which are isolated, smart contract-to-smart contract markets for undercollateralized, yet permissionless, borrowing. \n\nInstead of using onchain credit scores or CeFi structures, Seamless uses an innovative architecture where funds are abstracted and maintained by smart contracts, preventing any user from running away with the funds. In addition to Aave-like borrowing, borrowers may also select strategies to amplify their LST exposure for up to 4x (starting with cbETH).",

Aerodrome is a public good for Base (having had no VC funding) that returns 100% of its revenue to the ecosystem. Aerodrome is Base's largest protocol, has already onboarded 20 new protocols to the ecosystem, and has generated over $7.5M in value in 7 weeks. It is designed to support public goods, as 21% of the protocol\u2019s voting power is dedicated to supporting key ecosystem liquidity pairs, with fees created from those pairs used to direct support to public goods on Base. Further, we have improved the developer ecosystem and decentralization by bringing best practices and ensuring 3rd-party development apps function on BASE.",

Furthermore, Galxe\u2019s contribution to the Optimism Quest shined a spotlight on the Optimism ecosystem and its protocols. The Optimism Quest onboarded new users to Optimism and powered protocol retention\n\nSince Galxe integrated Optimism in July 2022, Galxe has directly powered 6,238,175 unique transactions through the Optimism network. In addition, Galxe partners have launched a total of 1296 quests deployed on Optimism via Galxe\n\nBy engaging with Galxe campaigns, users enable themselves to build their identity/reputation within the Optimism ecosystem by collecting Optimism OATs and NFTs among other achievements.

Optimism Prices' sole focus and dedication to the Optimism ecosystem allows us to maintain well-engineered integrations for the popular destinations for tokens on Optimism and Base, which lets us guarantee 100% coverage for pricing any asset. As a result, Optimism Prices is the sole price feed relied on by Velodrome and Aerodrome, the #2 and #1 projects by TVL on OP Mainnet and Base respectively.",

With 152 of 195 countries being developing, reducing blockchain entry barriers is vital for global adoption. Inverter's modular infrastructure significantly cuts down smart contract setup time and running costs for new applications.\n\nWe onboarded projects that are building on Optimism by making it possible to deploy web3 products in an agile way. With Inverter workflows, implementing smart contracts is only configuration process, rather than engineering challenge: \n- No more need to individually finance audits and security protocols \n- No more need for dedicated smart contract team or timely development cycles to implement new features or modify the old ones.",

The FOAM team has also provided developer feedback to OP Labs. Proof of Location is a new unlocked primitive for novel applications bringing mindshare, awareness and new ideas to OP.\n\nFOAM represents the first DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) network to build on Optimism bringing fault-tolerant location data onchain to the Superchain. This has a signaling effect on the rest of the web3 ecosystem, that Optimism can be a hub for DePIN networks.",

According to the layers, Tockable produces a suitable online-app that allows users to select and compose their desired design before minting.\nCurrently, the market of traditional NFTs (random-static jpgs) has no more demand. On the other hand, the creation of dynamic and creative NFTs is currently only limited to developers. Tockable intends to make this possibility more easily available to the public and creators\n",

        "Contribution Description": "The wallet user experience for interacting with Layer 2s was a major hinderance to their adoption. By default, wallets only supported mainnet or required users to manually add an RPC to interact with L2s. Wallet balances were siloed by network, causing friction when using multiple chains and leading many users to perceive their OP assets as secondary to their assets on mainnet.\n\nSince 2021, Rainbow Wallet has prioritized its support for L2 networks and introduced new design patterns that dramatically improved their usability. Rainbow was first to offer native L2 support (without having to manually add RPCs), implement frictionless in-app swapping and bridging between networks, and establish a multinetwork UI that consolidates mainnet and L2 assets - now the UX standard for many wallets.",

Our strategy ensures a fee-free experience (zero registration fees and no renewals) while keeping initial registration gas costs to a minimum in contrast to Ethereum. Furthermore, these subnames are seamlessly integrated with the ENS infrastructure and are fully compatible with a wide array of popular wallets, including Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, Uniswap Wallet, Rainbow Wallet, as well as libraries such as Web3.js and ethers.js",

We have consistently advocated and shared our demos and open source code in the ENS community, including attending the weekly ENS DAO ecosystem call and attended Ethereum conferences this year including Eth Denver, Eth Waterloo, Eth CC, where we have engaged in onboarding developers to ENS and to using ENS on OP Stack L2s using our open source codebase.
